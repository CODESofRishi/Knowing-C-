4         PROLOGUE

5         Two households, both alike in dignity,
6         In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
7         From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
8         Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
9         From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
10        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
11        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
12        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
13        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
14        And the continuance of their parents' rage,Chorus. Two households, both alike in dignity,

29        Act I, Scene 1

30        Verona. A public place.

31             	 
32        [Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers]

33        Sampson. Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
34        Gregory. No, for then we should be colliers.
35        Sampson. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
36        Gregory. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.20
37        Sampson. I strike quickly, being moved.
38        Gregory. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
39        Sampson. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
40        Gregory. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
41        therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.25
42        Sampson. A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
43        take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
44        Gregory. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
45        to the wall.
46        Sampson. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,30
47        are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
48        Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
49        to the wall.
50        Gregory. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
51        Sampson. 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I35
52        have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
53        maids, and cut off their heads.
54        Gregory. The heads of the maids?
55        Sampson. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
56        take it in what sense thou wilt.40
57        Gregory. They must take it in sense that feel it.
58        Sampson. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
59        'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
60        Gregory. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
61        hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes45
62        two of the house of the Montagues.
63        Sampson. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
64        Gregory. How! turn thy back and run?
65        Sampson. Fear me not.
66        Gregory. No, marry; I fear thee!50
67        Sampson. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
68        Gregory. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
69        they list.
70        Sampson. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
71        which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.55
72        [Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]

73        Abraham. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
74        Sampson. I do bite my thumb, sir.
75        Abraham. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
76        Sampson. [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say60
77        ay?
78        Gregory. No.
79        Sampson. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
80        bite my thumb, sir.
81        Gregory. Do you quarrel, sir?65
82        Abraham. Quarrel sir! no, sir.
83        Sampson. If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
84        Abraham. No better.
85        Sampson. Well, sir.
86        Gregory. Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.70
87        Sampson. Yes, better, sir.
88        Abraham. You lie.
89        Sampson. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
90        [They fight]

91        [Enter BENVOLIO]

92        Benvolio. Part, fools!
93        Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
94        [Beats down their swords]

95        [Enter TYBALT]

96        Tybalt. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?80
97        Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
98        Benvolio. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
99        Or manage it to part these men with me.
100       Tybalt. What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
101       As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:85
102       Have at thee, coward!
103       [They fight]
104       [Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
105       then enter Citizens, with clubs]
106       First Citizen. Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!90
107       Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
108       [Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]

109       Capulet. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
110       Lady Capulet. A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
111       Capulet. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,95
112       And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
113       [Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

114       Montague. Thou villain Capulet,—Hold me not, let me go.
115       Lady Montague. Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
116       [Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]

117       Prince Escalus. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
118       Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
119       Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
120       That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
121       With purple fountains issuing from your veins,105
122       On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
123       Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
124       And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
125       Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
126       By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,110
127       Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
128       And made Verona's ancient citizens
129       Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
130       To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
131       Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:115
132       If ever you disturb our streets again,
133       Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
134       For this time, all the rest depart away:
135       You Capulet; shall go along with me:
136       And, Montague, come you this afternoon,120
137       To know our further pleasure in this case,
138       To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
139       Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
140       [Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]

141       Montague. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?125
142       Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
143       Benvolio. Here were the servants of your adversary,
144       And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
145       I drew to part them: in the instant came
146       The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,130
147       Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
148       He swung about his head and cut the winds,
149       Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
150       While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
151       Came more and more and fought on part and part,135
152       Till the prince came, who parted either part.
153       Lady Montague. O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
154       Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
155       Benvolio. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
156       Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,140
157       A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
158       Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
159       That westward rooteth from the city's side,
160       So early walking did I see your son:
161       Towards him I made, but he was ware of me145
162       And stole into the covert of the wood:
163       I, measuring his affections by my own,
164       That most are busied when they're most alone,
165       Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
166       And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.150
167       Montague. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
168       With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
169       Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
170       But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
171       Should in the furthest east begin to draw155
172       The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
173       Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
174       And private in his chamber pens himself,
175       Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
176       And makes himself an artificial night:160
177       Black and portentous must this humour prove,
178       Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
179       Benvolio. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
180       Montague. I neither know it nor can learn of him.
181       Benvolio. Have you importuned him by any means?165
182       Montague. Both by myself and many other friends:
183       But he, his own affections' counsellor,
184       Is to himself—I will not say how true—
185       But to himself so secret and so close,
186       So far from sounding and discovery,170
187       As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
188       Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
189       Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
190       Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
191       We would as willingly give cure as know.175
192       [Enter ROMEO]

193       Benvolio. See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
194       I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
195       Montague. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
196       To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.180
197       [Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

198       Benvolio. Good-morrow, cousin.
199       Romeo. Is the day so young?
200       Benvolio. But new struck nine.
201       Romeo. Ay me! sad hours seem long.185
202       Was that my father that went hence so fast?
203       Benvolio. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
204       Romeo. Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
205       Benvolio. In love?
206       Romeo. Out—190
207       Benvolio. Of love?
208       Romeo. Out of her favour, where I am in love.
209       Benvolio. Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
210       Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
211       Romeo. Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,195
212       Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
213       Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
214       Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
215       Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
216       Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!200
217       O any thing, of nothing first create!
218       O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
219       Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
220       Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
221       sick health!205
222       Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
223       This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
224       Dost thou not laugh?
225       Benvolio. No, coz, I rather weep.
226       Romeo. Good heart, at what?210
227       Benvolio. At thy good heart's oppression.
228       Romeo. Why, such is love's transgression.
229       Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
230       Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
231       With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown215
232       Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
233       Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
234       Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
235       Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
236       What is it else? a madness most discreet,220
237       A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
238       Farewell, my coz.
239       Benvolio. Soft! I will go along;
240       An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
241       Romeo. Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;225
242       This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
243       Benvolio. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
244       Romeo. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
245       Benvolio. Groan! why, no.
246       But sadly tell me who.230
247       Romeo. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
248       Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
249       In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
250       Benvolio. I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
251       Romeo. A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.235
252       Benvolio. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
253       Romeo. Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
254       With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
255       And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
256       From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.240
257       She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
258       Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
259       Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
260       O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
261       That when she dies with beauty dies her store.245
262       Benvolio. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
263       Romeo. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
264       For beauty starved with her severity
265       Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
266       She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,250
267       To merit bliss by making me despair:
268       She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
269       Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
270       Benvolio. Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
271       Romeo. O, teach me how I should forget to think.255
272       Benvolio. By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
273       Examine other beauties.
274       Romeo. 'Tis the way
275       To call hers exquisite, in question more:
276       These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows260
277       Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
278       He that is strucken blind cannot forget
279       The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
280       Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
281       What doth her beauty serve, but as a note265
282       Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
283       Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
284       Benvolio. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
285       [Exeunt]

288       A street.

289            	 
290       [Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]

291       Capulet. But Montague is bound as well as I,
292       In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
293       For men so old as we to keep the peace.
294       Paris. Of honourable reckoning are you both;
295       And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.275
296       But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
297       Capulet. But saying o'er what I have said before:
298       My child is yet a stranger in the world;
299       She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
300       Let two more summers wither in their pride,280
301       Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
302       Paris. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
303       Capulet. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
304       The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
305       She is the hopeful lady of my earth:285
306       But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
307       My will to her consent is but a part;
308       An she agree, within her scope of choice
309       Lies my consent and fair according voice.
310       This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,290
311       Whereto I have invited many a guest,
312       Such as I love; and you, among the store,
313       One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
314       At my poor house look to behold this night
315       Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:295
316       Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
317       When well-apparell'd April on the heel
318       Of limping winter treads, even such delight
319       Among fresh female buds shall you this night
320       Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,300
321       And like her most whose merit most shall be:
322       Which on more view, of many mine being one
323       May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
324       Come, go with me.
325       [To Servant, giving a paper]305
326       Go, sirrah, trudge about
327       Through fair Verona; find those persons out
328       Whose names are written there, and to them say,
329       My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
330       [Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]

331       Servant. Find them out whose names are written here! It is
332       written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
333       yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
334       his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
335       sent to find those persons whose names are here315
336       writ, and can never find what names the writing
337       person hath here writ. I must to the learned.—In good time.
338       [Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]

339       Benvolio. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
340       One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;320
341       Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
342       One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
343       Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
344       And the rank poison of the old will die.
345       Romeo. Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.325
346       Benvolio. For what, I pray thee?
347       Romeo. For your broken shin.
348       Benvolio. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
349       Romeo. Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
350       Shut up in prison, kept without my food,330
351       Whipp'd and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
352       Servant. God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
353       Romeo. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
354       Servant. Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
355       pray, can you read any thing you see?335
356       Romeo. Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
357       Servant. Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
358       Romeo. Stay, fellow; I can read.
359       [Reads]
360       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;340
361       County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
362       widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
363       nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
364       uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
365       Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin345
366       Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
367       assembly: whither should they come?
368       Servant. Up.
369       Romeo. Whither?
370       Servant. To supper; to our house.350
371       Romeo. Whose house?
372       Servant. My master's.
373       Romeo. Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
374       Servant. Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
375       great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house355
376       of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
377       Rest you merry!
378       [Exit]

379       Benvolio. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
380       Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,360
381       With all the admired beauties of Verona:
382       Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
383       Compare her face with some that I shall show,
384       And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
385       Romeo. When the devout religion of mine eye365
386       Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
387       And these, who often drown'd could never die,
388       Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
389       One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
390       Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.370
391       Benvolio. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
392       Herself poised with herself in either eye:
393       But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
394       Your lady's love against some other maid
395       That I will show you shining at this feast,375
396       And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
397       Romeo. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
398       But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

404       [Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]

405       Lady Capulet. Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
406       Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
407       I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
408       God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
409       [Enter JULIET]

410       Juliet. How now! who calls?
411       Nurse. Your mother.
412       Juliet. Madam, I am here.
413       What is your will?
414       Lady Capulet. This is the matter:—Nurse, give leave awhile,390
415       We must talk in secret:—nurse, come back again;
416       I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
417       Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
418       Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
419       Lady Capulet. She's not fourteen.395
420       Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,—
421       And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four—
422       She is not fourteen. How long is it now
423       To Lammas-tide?
424       Lady Capulet. A fortnight and odd days.400
425       Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
426       Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
427       Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—
428       Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
429       She was too good for me: but, as I said,405
430       On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
431       That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
432       'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
433       And she was wean'd,—I never shall forget it,—
434       Of all the days of the year, upon that day:410
435       For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
436       Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
437       My lord and you were then at Mantua:—
438       Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
439       When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple415
440       Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
441       To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
442       Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
443       To bid me trudge:
444       And since that time it is eleven years;420
445       For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
446       She could have run and waddled all about;
447       For even the day before, she broke her brow:
448       And then my husband—God be with his soul!
449       A' was a merry man—took up the child:425
450       'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
451       Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
452       Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
453       The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
454       To see, now, how a jest shall come about!430
455       I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
456       I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
457       And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
458       Lady Capulet. Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
459       Nurse. Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,435
460       To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
461       And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
462       A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
463       A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
464       'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?440
465       Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
466       Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
467       Juliet. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
468       Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
469       Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:445
470       An I might live to see thee married once,
471       I have my wish.
472       Lady Capulet. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
473       I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
474       How stands your disposition to be married?450
475       Juliet. It is an honour that I dream not of.
476       Nurse. An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
477       I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
478       Lady Capulet. Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
479       Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,455
480       Are made already mothers: by my count,
481       I was your mother much upon these years
482       That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
483       The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
484       Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man460
485       As all the world—why, he's a man of wax.
486       Lady Capulet. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
487       Nurse. Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
488       Lady Capulet. What say you? can you love the gentleman?
489       This night you shall behold him at our feast;465
490       Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
491       And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
492       Examine every married lineament,
493       And see how one another lends content
494       And what obscured in this fair volume lies470
495       Find written in the margent of his eyes.
496       This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
497       To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
498       The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
499       For fair without the fair within to hide:475
500       That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
501       That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
502       So shall you share all that he doth possess,
503       By having him, making yourself no less.
504       Nurse. No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.480
505       Lady Capulet. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
506       Juliet. I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
507       But no more deep will I endart mine eye
508       Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
509       [Enter a Servant]

510       Servant. Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
511       called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in

513       hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
514       Lady Capulet. We follow thee.490

523       [Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six [p]Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]

524       Romeo. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
525       Or shall we on without a apology?
526       Benvolio. The date is out of such prolixity:
527       We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,500
528       Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
529       Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
530       Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
531       After the prompter, for our entrance:
532       But let them measure us by what they will;505
533       We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
534       Romeo. Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
535       Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
536       Mercutio. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
537       Romeo. Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes510
538       With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
539       So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
540       Mercutio. You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
541       And soar with them above a common bound.
542       Romeo. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft515
543       To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
544       I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
545       Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
546       Mercutio. And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
547       Too great oppression for a tender thing.520
548       Romeo. Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
549       Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
550       Mercutio. If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
551       Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
552       Give me a case to put my visage in:525
553       A visor for a visor! what care I
554       What curious eye doth quote deformities?
555       Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
556       Benvolio. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
557       But every man betake him to his legs.530
558       Romeo. A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
559       Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
560       For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
561       I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
562       The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.535
563       Mercutio. Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
564       If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
565       Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
566       Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
567       Romeo. Nay, that's not so.540
568       Mercutio. I mean, sir, in delay
569       We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
570       Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
571       Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
572       Romeo. And we mean well in going to this mask;545
573       But 'tis no wit to go.
574       Mercutio. Why, may one ask?
575       Romeo. I dream'd a dream to-night.
576       Mercutio. And so did I.
577       Romeo. Well, what was yours?550
578       Mercutio. That dreamers often lie.
579       Romeo. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
580       Mercutio. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
581       She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
582       In shape no bigger than an agate-stone555
583       On the fore-finger of an alderman,
584       Drawn with a team of little atomies
585       Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
586       Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
587       The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,560
588       The traces of the smallest spider's web,
589       The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
590       Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
591       Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
592       Not so big as a round little worm565
593       Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
594       Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
595       Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
596       Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
597       And in this state she gallops night by night570
598       Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
599       O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
600       O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
601       O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
602       Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,575
603       Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
604       Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
605       And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
606       And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
607       Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,580
608       Then dreams, he of another benefice:
609       Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
610       And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
611       Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
612       Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon585
613       Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
614       And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
615       And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
616       That plats the manes of horses in the night,
617       And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,590
618       Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
619       This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
620       That presses them and learns them first to bear,
621       Making them women of good carriage:
622       This is she—595
623       Romeo. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
624       Thou talk'st of nothing.
625       Mercutio. True, I talk of dreams,
626       Which are the children of an idle brain,
627       Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,600
628       Which is as thin of substance as the air
629       And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
630       Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
631       And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
632       Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.605
633       Benvolio. This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
634       Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
635       Romeo. I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
636       Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
637       Shall bitterly begin his fearful date610
638       With this night's revels and expire the term
639       Of a despised life closed in my breast
640       By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
641       But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
642       Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.615
643       Benvolio. Strike, drum.

652       Second Servant. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's

667       Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
668       Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,

683       Were in a mask?

687       Come pentecost as quickly as it will,

695       Of yonder knight?

698       It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
699       Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
700       Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
701       So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,670
702       As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
703       The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
704       And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
705       Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
706       For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.675
707       Tybalt. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
708       Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
709       Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
710       To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
711       Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,680
712       To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
713       Capulet. Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
714       Tybalt. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
715       A villain that is hither come in spite,
716       To scorn at our solemnity this night.685
717       Capulet. Young Romeo is it?
718       Tybalt. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
719       Capulet. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
720       He bears him like a portly gentleman;
721       And, to say truth, Verona brags of him690
722       To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
723       I would not for the wealth of all the town
724       Here in my house do him disparagement:
725       Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
726       It is my will, the which if thou respect,695
727       Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
728       And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
729       Tybalt. It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
730       I'll not endure him.
731       Capulet. He shall be endured:700
732       What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
733       Am I the master here, or you? go to.
734       You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
735       You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
736       You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!705
737       Tybalt. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
738       Capulet. Go to, go to;
739       You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
740       This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
741       You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.710
742       Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
743       Be quiet, or—More light, more light! For shame!
744       I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
745       Tybalt. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
746       Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.715
747       I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
748       Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
749       [Exit]

750       Romeo. [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
751       This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:720
752       My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
753       To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
754       Juliet. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
755       Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
756       For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,725
757       And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
758       Romeo. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
759       Juliet. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
760       Romeo. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
761       They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.730
762       Juliet. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
763       Romeo. Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
764       Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
765       Juliet. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
766       Romeo. Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!735
767       Give me my sin again.
768       Juliet. You kiss by the book.
769       Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
770       Romeo. What is her mother?
771       Nurse. Marry, bachelor,740
772       Her mother is the lady of the house,
773       And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
774       I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
775       I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
776       Shall have the chinks.745
777       Romeo. Is she a Capulet?
778       O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
779       Benvolio. Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
780       Romeo. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
781       Capulet. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;750
782       We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
783       Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
784       I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
785       More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
786       Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:755
787       I'll to my rest.
788       [Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]

789       Juliet. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
790       Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
791       Juliet. What's he that now is going out of door?760
792       Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
793       Juliet. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
794       Nurse. I know not.
795       Juliet. Go ask his name: if he be married.
796       My grave is like to be my wedding bed.765
797       Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
798       The only son of your great enemy.
799       Juliet. My only love sprung from my only hate!
800       Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
801       Prodigious birth of love it is to me,770
802       That I must love a loathed enemy.
803       Nurse. What's this? what's this?
804       Juliet. A rhyme I learn'd even now
805       Of one I danced withal.
806       [One calls within 'Juliet.']

807       Nurse. Anon, anon!
808       Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

811       Prologue

812            	 
813       [Enter Chorus]

814       Chorus. Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,780
815       And young affection gapes to be his heir;
816       That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
817       With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
818       Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
819       Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,785
820       But to his foe supposed he must complain,
821       And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
822       Being held a foe, he may not have access
823       To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
824       And she as much in love, her means much less790
825       To meet her new-beloved any where:
826       But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
827       Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

833       [Enter ROMEO]

834       Romeo. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
835       Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
836       [He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it]

837       [Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]

838       Benvolio. Romeo! my cousin Romeo!800
839       Mercutio. He is wise;
840       And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
841       Benvolio. He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
842       Call, good Mercutio.
843       Mercutio. Nay, I'll conjure too.805
844       Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
845       Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
846       Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
847       Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
848       Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,810
849       One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
850       Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
851       When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
852       He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
853       The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.815
854       I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
855       By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
856       By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
857       And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
858       That in thy likeness thou appear to us!820
859       Benvolio. And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
860       Mercutio. This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
861       To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
862       Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
863       Till she had laid it and conjured it down;825
864       That were some spite: my invocation
865       Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
866       I conjure only but to raise up him.
867       Benvolio. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
868       To be consorted with the humorous night:830
869       Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
870       Mercutio. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
871       Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
872       And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
873       As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.835
874       Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
875       An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
876       Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
877       This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
878       Come, shall we go?840
879       Benvolio. Go, then; for 'tis in vain
880       To seek him here that means not to be found.

887       Romeo. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.845
888       [JULIET appears above at a window]
889       But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
890       It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
891       Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
892       Who is already sick and pale with grief,850
893       That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
894       Be not her maid, since she is envious;
895       Her vestal livery is but sick and green
896       And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
897       It is my lady, O, it is my love!855
898       O, that she knew she were!
899       She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
900       Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
901       I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
902       Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,860
903       Having some business, do entreat her eyes
904       To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
905       What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
906       The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
907       As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven865
908       Would through the airy region stream so bright
909       That birds would sing and think it were not night.
910       See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
911       O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
912       That I might touch that cheek!870
913       Juliet. Ay me!
914       Romeo. She speaks:
915       O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
916       As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
917       As is a winged messenger of heaven875
918       Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
919       Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
920       When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
921       And sails upon the bosom of the air.
922       Juliet. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?880
923       Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
924       Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
925       And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
926       Romeo. [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
927       Juliet. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;885
928       Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
929       What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
930       Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
931       Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
932       What's in a name? that which we call a rose890
933       By any other name would smell as sweet;
934       So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
935       Retain that dear perfection which he owes
936       Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
937       And for that name which is no part of thee895
938       Take all myself.
939       Romeo. I take thee at thy word:
940       Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
941       Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
942       Juliet. What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night900
943       So stumblest on my counsel?
944       Romeo. By a name
945       I know not how to tell thee who I am:
946       My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
947       Because it is an enemy to thee;905
948       Had I it written, I would tear the word.
949       Juliet. My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
950       Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
951       Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
952       Romeo. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.910
953       Juliet. How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
954       The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
955       And the place death, considering who thou art,
956       If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
957       Romeo. With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;915
958       For stony limits cannot hold love out,
959       And what love can do that dares love attempt;
960       Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
961       Juliet. If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
962       Romeo. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye920
963       Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
964       And I am proof against their enmity.
965       Juliet. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
966       Romeo. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
967       And but thou love me, let them find me here:925
968       My life were better ended by their hate,
969       Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
970       Juliet. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
971       Romeo. By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
972       He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.930
973       I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
974       As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
975       I would adventure for such merchandise.
976       Juliet. Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
977       Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek935
978       For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
979       Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
980       What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
981       Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
982       And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,940
983       Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
984       Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
985       If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
986       Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
987       I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,945
988       So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
989       In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
990       And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
991       But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
992       Than those that have more cunning to be strange.950
993       I should have been more strange, I must confess,
994       But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
995       My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
996       And not impute this yielding to light love,
997       Which the dark night hath so discovered.955
998       Romeo. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
999       That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—
1000      Juliet. O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1001      That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1002      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.960
1003      Romeo. What shall I swear by?
1004      Juliet. Do not swear at all;
1005      Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1006      Which is the god of my idolatry,
1007      And I'll believe thee.965
1008      Romeo. If my heart's dear love—
1009      Juliet. Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1010      I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1011      It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1012      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be970
1013      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1014      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1015      May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1016      Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1017      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!975
1018      Romeo. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1019      Juliet. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1020      Romeo. The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1021      Juliet. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1022      And yet I would it were to give again.980
1023      Romeo. Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1024      Juliet. But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1025      And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1026      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1027      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,985
1028      The more I have, for both are infinite.
1029      [Nurse calls within]
1030      I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1031      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1032      Stay but a little, I will come again.990
1033      [Exit, above]

1034      Romeo. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1035      Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1036      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1037      [Re-enter JULIET, above]

1038      Juliet. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1039      If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1040      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1041      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1042      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;1000
1043      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1044      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1045      Nurse. [Within] Madam!
1046      Juliet. I come, anon.—But if thou mean'st not well,
1047      I do beseech thee—1005
1048      Nurse. [Within] Madam!
1049      Juliet. By and by, I come:—
1050      To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1051      To-morrow will I send.
1052      Romeo. So thrive my soul—1010
1053      Juliet. A thousand times good night!
1054      [Exit, above]

1055      Romeo. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1056      Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1057      their books,1015
1058      But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1059      [Retiring]

1060      [Re-enter JULIET, above]

1061      Juliet. Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1062      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!1020
1063      Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1064      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1065      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1066      With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1067      Romeo. It is my soul that calls upon my name:1025
1068      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1069      Like softest music to attending ears!
1070      Juliet. Romeo!
1071      Romeo. My dear?
1072      Juliet. At what o'clock to-morrow1030
1073      Shall I send to thee?
1074      Romeo. At the hour of nine.
1075      Juliet. I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1076      I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1077      Romeo. Let me stand here till thou remember it.1035
1078      Juliet. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1079      Remembering how I love thy company.
1080      Romeo. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1081      Forgetting any other home but this.
1082      Juliet. 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:1040
1083      And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1084      Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1085      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1086      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1087      So loving-jealous of his liberty.1045
1088      Romeo. I would I were thy bird.
1089      Juliet. Sweet, so would I:
1090      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1091      Good night, good night! parting is such
1092      sweet sorrow,1050
1093      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1094      [Exit above]

1095      Romeo. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1096      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1097      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,1055
1098      His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

1101      Act II, Scene 3

1102      Friar Laurence’s cell.

1103           	 
1104      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]

1105      Friar Laurence. The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1106      Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,1060
1107      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1108      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1109      Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1110      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1111      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours1065
1112      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1113      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1114      What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1115      And from her womb children of divers kind
1116      We sucking on her natural bosom find,1070
1117      Many for many virtues excellent,
1118      None but for some and yet all different.
1119      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1120      In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1121      For nought so vile that on the earth doth live1075
1122      But to the earth some special good doth give,
1123      Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1124      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1125      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1126      And vice sometimes by action dignified.1080
1127      Within the infant rind of this small flower
1128      Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1129      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1130      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1131      Two such opposed kings encamp them still1085
1132      In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1133      And where the worser is predominant,
1134      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1135      [Enter ROMEO]

1136      Romeo. Good morrow, father.1090
1137      Friar Laurence. Benedicite!
1138      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1139      Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1140      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1141      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,1095
1142      And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1143      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1144      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1145      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1146      Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;1100
1147      Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1148      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1149      Romeo. That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1150      Friar Laurence. God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1151      Romeo. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;1105
1152      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1153      Friar Laurence. That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1154      Romeo. I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1155      I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1156      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,1110
1157      That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1158      Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1159      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1160      My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1161      Friar Laurence. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;1115
1162      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1163      Romeo. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1164      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1165      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1166      And all combined, save what thou must combine1120
1167      By holy marriage: when and where and how
1168      We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1169      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1170      That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1171      Friar Laurence. Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!1125
1172      Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1173      So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1174      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1175      Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1176      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!1130
1177      How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1178      To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1179      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1180      Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1181      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit1135
1182      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1183      If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1184      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1185      And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1186      Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.1140
1187      Romeo. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1188      Friar Laurence. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1189      Romeo. And bad'st me bury love.
1190      Friar Laurence. Not in a grave,
1191      To lay one in, another out to have.1145
1192      Romeo. I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1193      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1194      The other did not so.
1195      Friar Laurence. O, she knew well
1196      Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.1150
1197      But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1198      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1199      For this alliance may so happy prove,
1200      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1201      Romeo. O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.1155
1202      Friar Laurence. Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

1208      [Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]

1209      Mercutio. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1210      Came he not home to-night?1160
1211      Benvolio. Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1212      Mercutio. Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1213      Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1214      Benvolio. Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1215      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.1165
1216      Mercutio. A challenge, on my life.
1217      Benvolio. Romeo will answer it.
1218      Mercutio. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1219      Benvolio. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1220      dares, being dared.1170
1221      Mercutio. Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1222      white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1223      love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1224      blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1225      encounter Tybalt?1175
1226      Benvolio. Why, what is Tybalt?
1227      Mercutio. More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1228      the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1229      you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1230      proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and1180
1231      the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1232      button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1233      very first house, of the first and second cause:
1234      ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1235      hai!1185
1236      Benvolio. The what?
1237      Mercutio. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1238      fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1239      a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1240      whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,1190
1241      grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1242      these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1243      perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1244      that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1245      bones, their bones!1195
1246      [Enter ROMEO]

1247      Benvolio. Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1248      Mercutio. Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1249      how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1250      that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a1200
1251      kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1252      be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1253      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1254      eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1255      Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation1205
1256      to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1257      fairly last night.
1258      Romeo. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1259      Mercutio. The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1260      Romeo. Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in1210
1261      such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1262      Mercutio. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1263      constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1264      Romeo. Meaning, to court'sy.
1265      Mercutio. Thou hast most kindly hit it.1215
1266      Romeo. A most courteous exposition.
1267      Mercutio. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1268      Romeo. Pink for flower.
1269      Mercutio. Right.
1270      Romeo. Why, then is my pump well flowered.1220
1271      Mercutio. Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1272      worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1273      is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1274      Romeo. O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1275      singleness.1225
1276      Mercutio. Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1277      Romeo. Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1278      Mercutio. Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1279      done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1280      thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:1230
1281      was I with you there for the goose?
1282      Romeo. Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1283      not there for the goose.
1284      Mercutio. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1285      Romeo. Nay, good goose, bite not.1235
1286      Mercutio. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1287      sharp sauce.
1288      Romeo. And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1289      Mercutio. O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1290      inch narrow to an ell broad!1240
1291      Romeo. I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1292      to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1293      Mercutio. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1294      now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1295      thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:1245
1296      for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1297      that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1298      Benvolio. Stop there, stop there.
1299      Mercutio. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1300      Benvolio. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.1250
1301      Mercutio. O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1302      for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1303      meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1304      Romeo. Here's goodly gear!
1305      [Enter Nurse and PETER]

1306      Mercutio. A sail, a sail!
1307      Benvolio. Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1308      Nurse. Peter!
1309      Peter. Anon!
1310      Nurse. My fan, Peter.1260
1311      Mercutio. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1312      fairer face.
1313      Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1314      Mercutio. God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1315      Nurse. Is it good den?1265
1316      Mercutio. 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1317      dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1318      Nurse. Out upon you! what a man are you!
1319      Romeo. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1320      mar.1270
1321      Nurse. By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1322      quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1323      may find the young Romeo?
1324      Romeo. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1325      you have found him than he was when you sought him:1275
1326      I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1327      Nurse. You say well.
1328      Mercutio. Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1329      wisely, wisely.
1330      Nurse. if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with1280
1331      you.
1332      Benvolio. She will indite him to some supper.
1333      Mercutio. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1334      Romeo. What hast thou found?
1335      Mercutio. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,1285
1336      that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1337      [Sings]
1338      An old hare hoar,
1339      And an old hare hoar,
1340      Is very good meat in lent1290
1341      But a hare that is hoar
1342      Is too much for a score,
1343      When it hoars ere it be spent.
1344      Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1345      to dinner, thither.1295
1346      Romeo. I will follow you.
1347      Mercutio. Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1348      [Singing]
1349      'lady, lady, lady.'
1350      [Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]

1351      Nurse. Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1352      merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1353      Romeo. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1354      and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1355      to in a month.1305
1356      Nurse. An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1357      down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1358      Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1359      Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1360      none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by1310
1361      too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1362      Peter. I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1363      should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1364      draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1365      good quarrel, and the law on my side.1315
1366      Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1367      me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1368      and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1369      out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1370      but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into1320
1371      a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1372      kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1373      is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1374      with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1375      to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.1325
1376      Romeo. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1377      protest unto thee—
1378      Nurse. Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1379      Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1380      Romeo. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.1330
1381      Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1382      I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1383      Romeo. Bid her devise
1384      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1385      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell1335
1386      Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1387      Nurse. No truly sir; not a penny.
1388      Romeo. Go to; I say you shall.
1389      Nurse. This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1390      Romeo. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:1340
1391      Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1392      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1393      Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1394      Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1395      Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:1345
1396      Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1397      Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1398      Romeo. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1399      Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1400      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?1350
1401      Romeo. I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1402      Nurse. Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady—Lord,
1403      Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:—O, there
1404      is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1405      lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief1355
1406      see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1407      sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1408      man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1409      as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1410      rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?1360
1411      Romeo. Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1412      Nurse. Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1413      the—No; I know it begins with some other
1414      letter:—and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1415      it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good1365
1416      to hear it.
1417      Romeo. Commend me to thy lady.
1418      Nurse. Ay, a thousand times.
1419      [Exit Romeo]
1420      Peter!1370
1421      Peter. Anon!
1422      Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

1428      [Enter JULIET]

1429      Juliet. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;1375
1430      In half an hour she promised to return.
1431      Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1432      O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1433      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1434      Driving back shadows over louring hills:1380
1435      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1436      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1437      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1438      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1439      Is three long hours, yet she is not come.1385
1440      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1441      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1442      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1443      And his to me:
1444      But old folks, many feign as they were dead;1390
1445      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1446      O God, she comes!
1447      [Enter Nurse and PETER]
1448      O honey nurse, what news?
1449      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.1395
1450      Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
1451      [Exit PETER]

1452      Juliet. Now, good sweet nurse,—O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1453      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1454      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news1400
1455      By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1456      Nurse. I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1457      Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1458      Juliet. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1459      Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.1405
1460      Nurse. Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1461      Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1462      Juliet. How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1463      To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1464      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay1410
1465      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1466      Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1467      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1468      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1469      Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not1415
1470      how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1471      face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1472      all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1473      though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1474      past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,1420
1475      but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1476      ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1477      Juliet. No, no: but all this did I know before.
1478      What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1479      Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!1425
1480      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1481      My back o' t' other side,—O, my back, my back!
1482      Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1483      To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1484      Juliet. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.1430
1485      Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1486      Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1487      courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1488      warrant, a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
1489      Juliet. Where is my mother! why, she is within;1435
1490      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1491      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1492      Where is your mother?'
1493      Nurse. O God's lady dear!
1494      Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;1440
1495      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1496      Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1497      Juliet. Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1498      Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1499      Juliet. I have.1445
1500      Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1501      There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1502      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1503      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1504      Hie you to church; I must another way,1450
1505      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1506      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1507      I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1508      But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1509      Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.1455
1510      Juliet. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

1516      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO]

1517      Friar Laurence. So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1518      That after hours with sorrow chide us not!1460
1519      Romeo. Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1520      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1521      That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1522      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1523      Then love-devouring death do what he dare;1465
1524      It is enough I may but call her mine.
1525      Friar Laurence. These violent delights have violent ends
1526      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1527      Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1528      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness1470
1529      And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1530      Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1531      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1532      [Enter JULIET]
1533      Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot1475
1534      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1535      A lover may bestride the gossamer
1536      That idles in the wanton summer air,
1537      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1538      Juliet. Good even to my ghostly confessor.1480
1539      Friar Laurence. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1540      Juliet. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1541      Romeo. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1542      Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1543      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath1485
1544      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1545      Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1546      Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1547      Juliet. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1548      Brags of his substance, not of ornament:1490
1549      They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1550      But my true love is grown to such excess
1551      I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
1552      Friar Laurence. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1553      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone1495
1554      Till holy church incorporate two in one.

1560      [Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]

1561      Benvolio. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
1562      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,1500
1563      And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
1564      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
1565      Mercutio. Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
1566      enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
1567      upon the table and says 'God send me no need of1505
1568      thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
1569      it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
1570      Benvolio. Am I like such a fellow?
1571      Mercutio. Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
1572      any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as1510
1573      soon moody to be moved.
1574      Benvolio. And what to?
1575      Mercutio. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
1576      shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
1577      thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,1515
1578      or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1579      wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1580      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1581      eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1582      Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of1520
1583      meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1584      an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1585      man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1586      wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1587      didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing1525
1588      his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1589      tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1590      wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
1591      Benvolio. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1592      should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.1530
1593      Mercutio. The fee-simple! O simple!
1594      Benvolio. By my head, here come the Capulets.
1595      Mercutio. By my heel, I care not.
1596      [Enter TYBALT and others]

1597      Tybalt. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.1535
1598      Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
1599      Mercutio. And but one word with one of us? couple it with
1600      something; make it a word and a blow.
1601      Tybalt. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
1602      will give me occasion.1540
1603      Mercutio. Could you not take some occasion without giving?
1604      Tybalt. Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,—
1605      Mercutio. Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
1606      thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
1607      discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall1545
1608      make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
1609      Benvolio. We talk here in the public haunt of men:
1610      Either withdraw unto some private place,
1611      And reason coldly of your grievances,
1612      Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.1550
1613      Mercutio. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
1614      I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
1615      [Enter ROMEO]

1616      Tybalt. Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
1617      Mercutio. But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:1555
1618      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
1619      Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
1620      Tybalt. Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
1621      No better term than this,—thou art a villain.
1622      Romeo. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee1560
1623      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
1624      To such a greeting: villain am I none;
1625      Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
1626      Tybalt. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
1627      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.1565
1628      Romeo. I do protest, I never injured thee,
1629      But love thee better than thou canst devise,
1630      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
1631      And so, good Capulet,—which name I tender
1632      As dearly as my own,—be satisfied.1570
1633      Mercutio. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
1634      Alla stoccata carries it away.
1635      [Draws]
1636      Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
1637      Tybalt. What wouldst thou have with me?1575
1638      Mercutio. Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
1639      lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
1640      shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
1641      eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
1642      by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your1580
1643      ears ere it be out.
1644      Tybalt. I am for you.
1645      [Drawing]

1646      Romeo. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
1647      Mercutio. Come, sir, your passado.1585
1648      [They fight]

1649      Romeo. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
1650      Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
1651      Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
1652      Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:1590
1653      Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
1654      [TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers]

1655      Mercutio. I am hurt.
1656      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
1657      Is he gone, and hath nothing?1595
1658      Benvolio. What, art thou hurt?
1659      Mercutio. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
1660      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
1661      [Exit Page]

1662      Romeo. Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.1600
1663      Mercutio. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
1664      church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
1665      me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
1666      am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
1667      both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a1605
1668      cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
1669      rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
1670      arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
1671      was hurt under your arm.
1672      Romeo. I thought all for the best.1610
1673      Mercutio. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
1674      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
1675      They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
1676      And soundly too: your houses!
1677      [Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]

1678      Romeo. This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
1679      My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
1680      In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
1681      With Tybalt's slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
1682      Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,1620
1683      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
1684      And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
1685      [Re-enter BENVOLIO]

1686      Benvolio. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
1687      That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,1625
1688      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
1689      Romeo. This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
1690      This but begins the woe, others must end.
1691      Benvolio. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
1692      Romeo. Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!1630
1693      Away to heaven, respective lenity,
1694      And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
1695      [Re-enter TYBALT]
1696      Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
1697      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul1635
1698      Is but a little way above our heads,
1699      Staying for thine to keep him company:
1700      Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
1701      Tybalt. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
1702      Shalt with him hence.1640
1703      Romeo. This shall determine that.
1704      [They fight; TYBALT falls]

1705      Benvolio. Romeo, away, be gone!
1706      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
1707      Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,1645
1708      If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
1709      Romeo. O, I am fortune's fool!
1710      Benvolio. Why dost thou stay?
1711      [Exit ROMEO]

1712      [Enter Citizens, &c]

1713      First Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
1714      Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
1715      Benvolio. There lies that Tybalt.
1716      First Citizen. Up, sir, go with me;
1717      I charge thee in the princes name, obey.1655
1718      [Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their]
1719      Wives, and others]
1720      Prince Escalus. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
1721      Benvolio. O noble prince, I can discover all
1722      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:1660
1723      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
1724      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
1725      Lady Capulet. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
1726      O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
1727      O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,1665
1728      For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
1729      O cousin, cousin!
1730      Prince Escalus. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
1731      Benvolio. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
1732      Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink1670
1733      How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
1734      Your high displeasure: all this uttered
1735      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
1736      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
1737      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts1675
1738      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
1739      Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
1740      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
1741      Cold death aside, and with the other sends
1742      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,1680
1743      Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
1744      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
1745      his tongue,
1746      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
1747      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm1685
1748      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
1749      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
1750      But by and by comes back to Romeo,
1751      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
1752      And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I1690
1753      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
1754      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
1755      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
1756      Lady Capulet. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
1757      Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:1695
1758      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
1759      And all those twenty could but kill one life.
1760      I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
1761      Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
1762      Prince Escalus. Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;1700
1763      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
1764      Montague. Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
1765      His fault concludes but what the law should end,
1766      The life of Tybalt.
1767      Prince Escalus. And for that offence1705
1768      Immediately we do exile him hence:
1769      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
1770      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
1771      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
1772      That you shall all repent the loss of mine:1710
1773      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
1774      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
1775      Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
1776      Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
1777      Bear hence this body and attend our will:1715
1778      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

1783           	 
1784      [Enter JULIET]

1785      Juliet. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
1786      Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner1720
1787      As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
1788      And bring in cloudy night immediately.
1789      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
1790      That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
1791      Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.1725
1792      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
1793      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
1794      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
1795      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
1796      And learn me how to lose a winning match,1730
1797      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
1798      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
1799      With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
1800      Think true love acted simple modesty.
1801      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;1735
1802      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
1803      Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
1804      Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
1805      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
1806      Take him and cut him out in little stars,1740
1807      And he will make the face of heaven so fine
1808      That all the world will be in love with night
1809      And pay no worship to the garish sun.
1810      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
1811      But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,1745
1812      Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
1813      As is the night before some festival
1814      To an impatient child that hath new robes
1815      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
1816      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks1750
1817      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
1818      [Enter Nurse, with cords]
1819      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
1820      That Romeo bid thee fetch?
1821      Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.1755
1822      [Throws them down]

1823      Juliet. Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
1824      Nurse. Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
1825      We are undone, lady, we are undone!
1826      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!1760
1827      Juliet. Can heaven be so envious?
1828      Nurse. Romeo can,
1829      Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
1830      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
1831      Juliet. What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?1765
1832      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
1833      Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
1834      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
1835      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
1836      I am not I, if there be such an I;1770
1837      Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
1838      If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
1839      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
1840      Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,—
1841      God save the mark!—here on his manly breast:1775
1842      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
1843      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
1844      All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
1845      Juliet. O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
1846      To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!1780
1847      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
1848      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
1849      Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
1850      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
1851      That ever I should live to see thee dead!1785
1852      Juliet. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
1853      Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
1854      My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
1855      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
1856      For who is living, if those two are gone?1790
1857      Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
1858      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
1859      Juliet. O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
1860      Nurse. It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
1861      Juliet. O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!1795
1862      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
1863      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
1864      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
1865      Despised substance of divinest show!
1866      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,1800
1867      A damned saint, an honourable villain!
1868      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
1869      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
1870      In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
1871      Was ever book containing such vile matter1805
1872      So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
1873      In such a gorgeous palace!
1874      Nurse. There's no trust,
1875      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
1876      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.1810
1877      Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
1878      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
1879      Shame come to Romeo!
1880      Juliet. Blister'd be thy tongue
1881      For such a wish! he was not born to shame:1815
1882      Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
1883      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
1884      Sole monarch of the universal earth.
1885      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
1886      Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?1820
1887      Juliet. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
1888      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
1889      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
1890      But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
1891      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:1825
1892      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
1893      Your tributary drops belong to woe,
1894      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
1895      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
1896      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:1830
1897      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
1898      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
1899      That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
1900      But, O, it presses to my memory,
1901      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:1835
1902      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo—banished;'
1903      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
1904      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
1905      Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
1906      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship1840
1907      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
1908      Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
1909      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
1910      Which modern lamentations might have moved?
1911      But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,1845
1912      'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
1913      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
1914      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
1915      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
1916      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.1850
1917      Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
1918      Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
1919      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
1920      Juliet. Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
1921      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.1855
1922      Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
1923      Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
1924      He made you for a highway to my bed;
1925      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
1926      Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;1860
1927      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
1928      Nurse. Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
1929      To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
1930      Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
1931      I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.1865
1932      Juliet. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
1933      And bid him come to take his last farewell.

1939      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]

1940      Friar Laurence. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:1870
1941      Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
1942      And thou art wedded to calamity.
1943      [Enter ROMEO]

1944      Romeo. Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
1945      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,1875
1946      That I yet know not?
1947      Friar Laurence. Too familiar
1948      Is my dear son with such sour company:
1949      I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
1950      Romeo. What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?1880
1951      Friar Laurence. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
1952      Not body's death, but body's banishment.
1953      Romeo. Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
1954      For exile hath more terror in his look,
1955      Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'1885
1956      Friar Laurence. Hence from Verona art thou banished:
1957      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
1958      Romeo. There is no world without Verona walls,
1959      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
1960      Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,1890
1961      And world's exile is death: then banished,
1962      Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
1963      Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
1964      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
1965      Friar Laurence. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!1895
1966      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
1967      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
1968      And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
1969      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
1970      Romeo. 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,1900
1971      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
1972      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
1973      Live here in heaven and may look on her;
1974      But Romeo may not: more validity,
1975      More honourable state, more courtship lives1905
1976      In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
1977      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
1978      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
1979      Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
1980      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;1910
1981      But Romeo may not; he is banished:
1982      Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
1983      They are free men, but I am banished.
1984      And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
1985      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,1915
1986      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
1987      But 'banished' to kill me?—'banished'?
1988      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
1989      Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
1990      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,1920
1991      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
1992      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
1993      Friar Laurence. Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
1994      Romeo. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
1995      Friar Laurence. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:1925
1996      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
1997      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
1998      Romeo. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
1999      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2000      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,1930
2001      It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2002      Friar Laurence. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2003      Romeo. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2004      Friar Laurence. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2005      Romeo. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:1935
2006      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2007      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2008      Doting like me and like me banished,
2009      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2010      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,1940
2011      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2012      [Knocking within]

2013      Friar Laurence. Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2014      Romeo. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2015      Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.1945
2016      [Knocking]

2017      Friar Laurence. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2018      Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2019      [Knocking]
2020      Run to my study. By and by! God's will,1950
2021      What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2022      [Knocking]
2023      Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2024      Nurse. [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2025      my errand;1955
2026      I come from Lady Juliet.
2027      Friar Laurence. Welcome, then.
2028      [Enter Nurse]

2029      Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2030      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?1960
2031      Friar Laurence. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2032      Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2033      Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2034      Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2035      Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.1965
2036      Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2037      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2038      Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2039      Romeo. Nurse!
2040      Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.1970
2041      Romeo. Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2042      Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2043      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2044      With blood removed but little from her own?
2045      Where is she? and how doth she? and what says1975
2046      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2047      Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2048      And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2049      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2050      And then down falls again.1980
2051      Romeo. As if that name,
2052      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2053      Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2054      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2055      In what vile part of this anatomy1985
2056      Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2057      The hateful mansion.
2058      [Drawing his sword]

2059      Friar Laurence. Hold thy desperate hand:
2060      Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:1990
2061      Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2062      The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2063      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2064      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2065      Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,1995
2066      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2067      Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2068      And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2069      By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2070      Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?2000
2071      Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2072      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2073      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2074      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2075      And usest none in that true use indeed2005
2076      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2077      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2078      Digressing from the valour of a man;
2079      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2080      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;2010
2081      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2082      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2083      Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2084      Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2085      And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.2015
2086      What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2087      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2088      There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2089      But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2090      The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend2020
2091      And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2092      A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2093      Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2094      But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2095      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:2025
2096      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2097      Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2098      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2099      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2100      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;2030
2101      Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2102      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2103      Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2104      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2105      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.2035
2106      Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2107      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2108      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2109      Romeo is coming.
2110      Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night2040
2111      To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2112      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2113      Romeo. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2114      Nurse. Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2115      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.2045
2116      [Exit]

2117      Romeo. How well my comfort is revived by this!
2118      Friar Laurence. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2119      Either be gone before the watch be set,
2120      Or by the break of day disguised from hence:2050
2121      Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2122      And he shall signify from time to time
2123      Every good hap to you that chances here:
2124      Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2125      Romeo. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,2055
2126      It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

2132      [Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]

2133      Capulet. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2134      That we have had no time to move our daughter:2060
2135      Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2136      And so did I:—Well, we were born to die.
2137      'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2138      I promise you, but for your company,
2139      I would have been a-bed an hour ago.2065
2140      Paris. These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2141      Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2142      Lady Capulet. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2143      To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2144      Capulet. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender2070
2145      Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2146      In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2147      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2148      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2149      And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next—2075
2150      But, soft! what day is this?
2151      Paris. Monday, my lord,
2152      Capulet. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2153      O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2154      She shall be married to this noble earl.2080
2155      Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2156      We'll keep no great ado,—a friend or two;
2157      For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2158      It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2159      Being our kinsman, if we revel much:2085
2160      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2161      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2162      Paris. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2163      Capulet. Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2164      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,2090
2165      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2166      Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2167      Afore me! it is so very very late,
2168      That we may call it early by and by.
2169      Good night.2095

2174           	 
2175      [Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]

2176      Juliet. Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2177      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2178      That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;2100
2179      Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2180      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2181      Romeo. It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2182      No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2183      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:2105
2184      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2185      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2186      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2187      Juliet. Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2188      It is some meteor that the sun exhales,2110
2189      To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2190      And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2191      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2192      Romeo. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2193      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.2115
2194      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2195      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2196      Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2197      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2198      I have more care to stay than will to go:2120
2199      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2200      How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2201      Juliet. It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2202      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2203      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.2125
2204      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2205      This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2206      Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2207      O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2208      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,2130
2209      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2210      O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2211      Romeo. More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2212      [Enter Nurse, to the chamber]

2213      Nurse. Madam!2135
2214      Juliet. Nurse?
2215      Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2216      The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2217      [Exit]

2218      Juliet. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.2140
2219      Romeo. Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2220      [He goeth down]

2221      Juliet. Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2222      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2223      For in a minute there are many days:2145
2224      O, by this count I shall be much in years
2225      Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2226      Romeo. Farewell!
2227      I will omit no opportunity
2228      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.2150
2229      Juliet. O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2230      Romeo. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2231      For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2232      Juliet. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2233      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,2155
2234      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2235      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2236      Romeo. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2237      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2238      [Exit]

2239      Juliet. O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2240      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2241      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2242      For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2243      But send him back.2165
2244      Lady Capulet. [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2245      Juliet. Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2246      Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2247      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2248      [Enter LADY CAPULET]

2249      Lady Capulet. Why, how now, Juliet!
2250      Juliet. Madam, I am not well.
2251      Lady Capulet. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2252      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2253      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;2175
2254      Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2255      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2256      Juliet. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2257      Lady Capulet. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2258      Which you weep for.2180
2259      Juliet. Feeling so the loss,
2260      Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2261      Lady Capulet. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2262      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2263      Juliet. What villain madam?2185
2264      Lady Capulet. That same villain, Romeo.
2265      Juliet. [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.—
2266      God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2267      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2268      Lady Capulet. That is, because the traitor murderer lives.2190
2269      Juliet. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2270      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2271      Lady Capulet. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2272      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2273      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,2195
2274      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2275      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2276      And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2277      Juliet. Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2278      With Romeo, till I behold him—dead—2200
2279      Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2280      Madam, if you could find out but a man
2281      To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2282      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2283      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors2205
2284      To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2285      To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2286      Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2287      Lady Capulet. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2288      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.2210
2289      Juliet. And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2290      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2291      Lady Capulet. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2292      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2293      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,2215
2294      That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2295      Juliet. Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2296      Lady Capulet. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2297      The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2298      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,2220
2299      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2300      Juliet. Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2301      He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2302      I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2303      Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.2225
2304      I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2305      I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2306      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2307      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2308      Lady Capulet. Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,2230
2309      And see how he will take it at your hands.
2310      [Enter CAPULET and Nurse]

2311      Capulet. When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2312      But for the sunset of my brother's son
2313      It rains downright.2235
2314      How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2315      Evermore showering? In one little body
2316      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2317      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2318      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,2240
2319      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2320      Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2321      Without a sudden calm, will overset
2322      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2323      Have you deliver'd to her our decree?2245
2324      Lady Capulet. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2325      I would the fool were married to her grave!
2326      Capulet. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2327      How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2328      Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,2250
2329      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2330      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2331      Juliet. Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2332      Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2333      But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.2255
2334      Capulet. How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2335      'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2336      And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2337      Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2338      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,2260
2339      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2340      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2341      Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2342      You tallow-face!
2343      Lady Capulet. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?2265
2344      Juliet. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2345      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2346      Capulet. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2347      I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2348      Or never after look me in the face:2270
2349      Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2350      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2351      That God had lent us but this only child;
2352      But now I see this one is one too much,
2353      And that we have a curse in having her:2275
2354      Out on her, hilding!
2355      Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
2356      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2357      Capulet. And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2358      Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.2280
2359      Nurse. I speak no treason.
2360      Capulet. O, God ye god-den.
2361      Nurse. May not one speak?
2362      Capulet. Peace, you mumbling fool!
2363      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;2285
2364      For here we need it not.
2365      Lady Capulet. You are too hot.
2366      Capulet. God's bread! it makes me mad:
2367      Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2368      Alone, in company, still my care hath been2290
2369      To have her match'd: and having now provided
2370      A gentleman of noble parentage,
2371      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2372      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2373      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;2295
2374      And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2375      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2376      To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2377      I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2378      But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:2300
2379      Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2380      Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2381      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2382      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2383      And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in2305
2384      the streets,
2385      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2386      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2387      Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
2388      [Exit]

2389      Juliet. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2390      That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2391      O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2392      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2393      Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed2315
2394      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2395      Lady Capulet. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2396      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
2397      [Exit]

2398      Juliet. O God!—O nurse, how shall this be prevented?2320
2399      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2400      How shall that faith return again to earth,
2401      Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2402      By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2403      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems2325
2404      Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2405      What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2406      Some comfort, nurse.
2407      Nurse. Faith, here it is.
2408      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,2330
2409      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2410      Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2411      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2412      I think it best you married with the county.
2413      O, he's a lovely gentleman!2335
2414      Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2415      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2416      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2417      I think you are happy in this second match,
2418      For it excels your first: or if it did not,2340
2419      Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2420      As living here and you no use of him.
2421      Juliet. Speakest thou from thy heart?
2422      Nurse. And from my soul too;
2423      Or else beshrew them both.2345
2424      Juliet. Amen!
2425      Nurse. What?
2426      Juliet. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
2427      Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
2428      Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,2350
2429      To make confession and to be absolved.
2430      Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
2431      [Exit]

2432      Juliet. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
2433      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,2355
2434      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
2435      Which she hath praised him with above compare
2436      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
2437      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
2438      I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:2360
2439      If all else fail, myself have power to die.

2443      Friar Laurence’s cell.

2444           	 
2445      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]

2446      Friar Laurence. On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
2447      Paris. My father Capulet will have it so;2365
2448      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
2449      Friar Laurence. You say you do not know the lady's mind:
2450      Uneven is the course, I like it not.
2451      Paris. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
2452      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;2370
2453      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
2454      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
2455      That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
2456      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
2457      To stop the inundation of her tears;2375
2458      Which, too much minded by herself alone,
2459      May be put from her by society:
2460      Now do you know the reason of this haste.
2461      Friar Laurence. [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
2462      Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.2380
2463      [Enter JULIET]

2464      Paris. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
2465      Juliet. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
2466      Paris. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
2467      Juliet. What must be shall be.2385
2468      Friar Laurence. That's a certain text.
2469      Paris. Come you to make confession to this father?
2470      Juliet. To answer that, I should confess to you.
2471      Paris. Do not deny to him that you love me.
2472      Juliet. I will confess to you that I love him.2390
2473      Paris. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
2474      Juliet. If I do so, it will be of more price,
2475      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
2476      Paris. Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
2477      Juliet. The tears have got small victory by that;2395
2478      For it was bad enough before their spite.
2479      Paris. Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
2480      Juliet. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
2481      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
2482      Paris. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.2400
2483      Juliet. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
2484      Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
2485      Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
2486      Friar Laurence. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
2487      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.2405
2488      Paris. God shield I should disturb devotion!
2489      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
2490      Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
2491      [Exit]

2492      Juliet. O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,2410
2493      Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
2494      Friar Laurence. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
2495      It strains me past the compass of my wits:
2496      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
2497      On Thursday next be married to this county.2415
2498      Juliet. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
2499      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
2500      If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
2501      Do thou but call my resolution wise,
2502      And with this knife I'll help it presently.2420
2503      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
2504      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
2505      Shall be the label to another deed,
2506      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
2507      Turn to another, this shall slay them both:2425
2508      Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
2509      Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
2510      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
2511      Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
2512      Which the commission of thy years and art2430
2513      Could to no issue of true honour bring.
2514      Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
2515      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
2516      Friar Laurence. Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
2517      Which craves as desperate an execution.2435
2518      As that is desperate which we would prevent.
2519      If, rather than to marry County Paris,
2520      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
2521      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
2522      A thing like death to chide away this shame,2440
2523      That copest with death himself to scape from it:
2524      And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
2525      Juliet. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
2526      From off the battlements of yonder tower;
2527      Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk2445
2528      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
2529      Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
2530      O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
2531      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
2532      Or bid me go into a new-made grave2450
2533      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
2534      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
2535      And I will do it without fear or doubt,
2536      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
2537      Friar Laurence. Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent2455
2538      To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
2539      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
2540      Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
2541      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
2542      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;2460
2543      When presently through all thy veins shall run
2544      A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
2545      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
2546      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
2547      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade2465
2548      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
2549      Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
2550      Each part, deprived of supple government,
2551      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
2552      And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death2470
2553      Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
2554      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
2555      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
2556      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
2557      Then, as the manner of our country is,2475
2558      In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
2559      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
2560      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
2561      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
2562      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,2480
2563      And hither shall he come: and he and I
2564      Will watch thy waking, and that very night
2565      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
2566      And this shall free thee from this present shame;
2567      If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,2485
2568      Abate thy valour in the acting it.
2569      Juliet. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
2570      Friar Laurence. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
2571      In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
2572      To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.2490
2573      Juliet. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
2574      Farewell, dear father!

2581      Capulet. So many guests invite as here are writ.2495
2582      [Exit First Servant]
2583      Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
2584      Second Servant. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
2585      can lick their fingers.
2586      Capulet. How canst thou try them so?2500
2587      Second Servant. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
2588      own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
2589      fingers goes not with me.
2590      Capulet. Go, be gone.
2591      [Exit Second Servant]2505
2592      We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
2593      What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
2594      Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
2595      Capulet. Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
2596      A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.2510
2597      Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
2598      [Enter JULIET]

2599      Capulet. How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
2600      Juliet. Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
2601      Of disobedient opposition2515
2602      To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
2603      By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
2604      And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
2605      Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
2606      Capulet. Send for the county; go tell him of this:2520
2607      I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
2608      Juliet. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
2609      And gave him what becomed love I might,
2610      Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
2611      Capulet. Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:2525
2612      This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
2613      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
2614      Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
2615      Our whole city is much bound to him.
2616      Juliet. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,2530
2617      To help me sort such needful ornaments
2618      As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
2619      Lady Capulet. No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
2620      Capulet. Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
2621      [Exeunt JULIET and Nurse]

2622      Lady Capulet. We shall be short in our provision:
2623      'Tis now near night.
2624      Capulet. Tush, I will stir about,
2625      And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
2626      Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;2540
2627      I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
2628      I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
2629      They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
2630      To County Paris, to prepare him up
2631      Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,2545
2632      Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

2640      I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,2550
2641      For I have need of many orisons
2642      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
2643      Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
2644      [Enter LADY CAPULET]

2645      Lady Capulet. What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?2555
2646      Juliet. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
2647      As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
2648      So please you, let me now be left alone,
2649      And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
2650      For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,2560
2651      In this so sudden business.
2652      Lady Capulet. Good night:
2653      Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
2654      [Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse]

2655      Juliet. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.2565
2656      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
2657      That almost freezes up the heat of life:
2658      I'll call them back again to comfort me:
2659      Nurse! What should she do here?
2660      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.2570
2661      Come, vial.
2662      What if this mixture do not work at all?
2663      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
2664      No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
2665      [Laying down her dagger]2575
2666      What if it be a poison, which the friar
2667      Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
2668      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
2669      Because he married me before to Romeo?
2670      I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,2580
2671      For he hath still been tried a holy man.
2672      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
2673      I wake before the time that Romeo
2674      Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
2675      Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,2585
2676      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
2677      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
2678      Or, if I live, is it not very like,
2679      The horrible conceit of death and night,
2680      Together with the terror of the place,—2590
2681      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
2682      Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
2683      Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
2684      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
2685      Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,2595
2686      At some hours in the night spirits resort;—
2687      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
2688      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
2689      And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
2690      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:—2600
2691      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2692      Environed with all these hideous fears?
2693      And madly play with my forefather's joints?
2694      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
2695      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,2605
2696      As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
2697      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
2698      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
2699      Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
2700      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.2610

2715      Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
2716      For this night's watching.
2717      Capulet. No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
2718      All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
2719      Lady Capulet. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;2625

2734      Capulet. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!2640
2735      Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:

2775      Help, help! Call help.
2776      [Enter CAPULET]

2777      Capulet. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
2778      Nurse. She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!2680
2779      Lady Capulet. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
2780      Capulet. Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
2781      Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
2782      Life and these lips have long been separated:
2783      Death lies on her like an untimely frost2685
2784      Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
2785      Nurse. O lamentable day!
2786      Lady Capulet. O woful time!
2787      Capulet. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
2788      Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.2690
2789      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians]

2790      Friar Laurence. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
2791      Capulet. Ready to go, but never to return.
2792      O son! the night before thy wedding-day
2793      Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,2695
2794      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
2795      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
2796      My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
2797      And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
2798      Paris. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,2700
2799      And doth it give me such a sight as this?
2800      Lady Capulet. Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
2801      Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
2802      In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
2803      But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,2705
2804      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
2805      And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
2806      Nurse. O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
2807      Most lamentable day, most woful day,
2808      That ever, ever, I did yet behold!2710
2809      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
2810      Never was seen so black a day as this:
2811      O woful day, O woful day!
2812      Paris. Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
2813      Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,2715
2814      By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
2815      O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
2816      Capulet. Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
2817      Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
2818      To murder, murder our solemnity?2720
2819      O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
2820      Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
2821      And with my child my joys are buried.
2822      Friar Laurence. Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
2823      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself2725
2824      Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
2825      And all the better is it for the maid:
2826      Your part in her you could not keep from death,
2827      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
2828      The most you sought was her promotion;2730
2829      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
2830      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
2831      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
2832      O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
2833      That you run mad, seeing that she is well:2735
2834      She's not well married that lives married long;
2835      But she's best married that dies married young.
2836      Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
2837      On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
2838      In all her best array bear her to church:2740
2839      For though fond nature bids us an lament,
2840      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
2841      Capulet. All things that we ordained festival,
2842      Turn from their office to black funeral;
2843      Our instruments to melancholy bells,2745
2844      Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
2845      Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
2846      Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
2847      And all things change them to the contrary.
2848      Friar Laurence. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;2750
2849      And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
2850      To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
2851      The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
2852      Move them no more by crossing their high will.
2853      [Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE]

2854      First Musician. Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
2855      Nurse. Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
2856      For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
2857      [Exit]

2858      First Musician. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.2760
2859      [Enter PETER]

2860      Peter. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
2861      ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
2862      First Musician. Why 'Heart's ease?'
2863      Peter. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My2765
2864      heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
2865      to comfort me.
2866      First Musician. Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
2867      Peter. You will not, then?
2868      First Musician. No.2770
2869      Peter. I will then give it you soundly.
2870      First Musician. What will you give us?
2871      Peter. No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
2872      I will give you the minstrel.
2873      First Musician. Then I will give you the serving-creature.2775
2874      Peter. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
2875      your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
2876      I'll fa you; do you note me?
2877      First Musician. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
2878      Second Musician. Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.2780
2879      Peter. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
2880      with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
2881      me like men:
2882      'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
2883      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,2785
2884      Then music with her silver sound'—
2885      why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
2886      sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
2887      First Musician. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
2888      Peter. Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?2790
2889      Second Musician. I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
2890      Peter. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
2891      Third Musician. Faith, I know not what to say.
2892      Peter. O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
2893      for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'2795
2894      because musicians have no gold for sounding:
2895      'Then music with her silver sound
2896      With speedy help doth lend redress.'
2897      [Exit]

2898      First Musician. What a pestilent knave is this same!2800
2899      Second Musician. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
2900      mourners, and stay dinner.

2904      Mantua. A street.

2906      [Enter ROMEO]

2907      Romeo. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,2805
2908      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
2909      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
2910      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
2911      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
2912      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead—2810
2913      Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
2914      to think!—
2915      And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
2916      That I revived, and was an emperor.
2917      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,2815
2918      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
2919      [Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
2920      News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar!
2921      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
2922      How doth my lady? Is my father well?2820
2923      How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
2924      For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
2925      Balthasar. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
2926      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
2927      And her immortal part with angels lives.2825
2928      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
2929      And presently took post to tell it you:
2930      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
2931      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
2932      Romeo. Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!2830
2933      Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
2934      And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
2935      Balthasar. I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
2936      Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
2937      Some misadventure.2835
2938      Romeo. Tush, thou art deceived:
2939      Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
2940      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
2941      Balthasar. No, my good lord.
2942      Romeo. No matter: get thee gone,2840
2943      And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
2944      [Exit BALTHASAR]
2945      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
2946      Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
2947      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!2845
2948      I do remember an apothecary,—
2949      And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
2950      In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
2951      Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
2952      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:2850
2953      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
2954      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
2955      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
2956      A beggarly account of empty boxes,
2957      Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,2855
2958      Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
2959      Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
2960      Noting this penury, to myself I said
2961      'An if a man did need a poison now,
2962      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,2860
2963      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
2964      O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
2965      And this same needy man must sell it me.
2966      As I remember, this should be the house.
2967      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.2865
2968      What, ho! apothecary!
2969      [Enter Apothecary]

2970      Apothecary. Who calls so loud?
2971      Romeo. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
2972      Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have2870
2973      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
2974      As will disperse itself through all the veins
2975      That the life-weary taker may fall dead
2976      And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
2977      As violently as hasty powder fired2875
2978      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
2979      Apothecary. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
2980      Is death to any he that utters them.
2981      Romeo. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
2982      And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,2880
2983      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
2984      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
2985      The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
2986      The world affords no law to make thee rich;
2987      Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.2885
2988      Apothecary. My poverty, but not my will, consents.
2989      Romeo. I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
2990      Apothecary. Put this in any liquid thing you will,
2991      And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
2992      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.2890
2993      Romeo. There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
2994      Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
2995      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
2996      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
2997      Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.2895
2998      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
2999      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

3005      [Enter FRIAR JOHN]

3006      Friar John. Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!2900
3007      [Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]

3008      Friar Laurence. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3009      Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3010      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3011      Friar John. Going to find a bare-foot brother out2905
3012      One of our order, to associate me,
3013      Here in this city visiting the sick,
3014      And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3015      Suspecting that we both were in a house
3016      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,2910
3017      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3018      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3019      Friar Laurence. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3020      Friar John. I could not send it,—here it is again,—
3021      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,2915
3022      So fearful were they of infection.
3023      Friar Laurence. Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3024      The letter was not nice but full of charge
3025      Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3026      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;2920
3027      Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3028      Unto my cell.
3029      Friar John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

3031      Friar Laurence. Now must I to the monument alone;2925
3032      Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3033      She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3034      Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3035      But I will write again to Mantua,
3036      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;2930
3037      Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

3044      Paris. Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3045      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.2935
3046      Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3047      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3048      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3049      Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3050      But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,2940
3051      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3052      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3053      Page. [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3054      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3055      [Retires]

3056      Paris. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,—
3057      O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;—
3058      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3059      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3060      The obsequies that I for thee will keep2950
3061      Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3062      [The Page whistles]
3063      The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3064      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3065      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?2955
3066      What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3067      [Retires]

3068      [Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, &c]

3069      Romeo. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3070      Hold, take this letter; early in the morning2960
3071      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3072      Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3073      Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3074      And do not interrupt me in my course.
3075      Why I descend into this bed of death,2965
3076      Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3077      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3078      A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3079      In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3080      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry2970
3081      In what I further shall intend to do,
3082      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3083      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3084      The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3085      More fierce and more inexorable far2975
3086      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3087      Balthasar. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3088      Romeo. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3089      Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3090      Balthasar. [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:2980
3091      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3092      [Retires]

3093      Romeo. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3094      Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3095      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,2985
3096      And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3097      [Opens the tomb]

3098      Paris. This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3099      That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3100      It is supposed, the fair creature died;2990
3101      And here is come to do some villanous shame
3102      To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3103      [Comes forward]
3104      Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3105      Can vengeance be pursued further than death?2995
3106      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3107      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3108      Romeo. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3109      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3110      Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;3000
3111      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3112      Put not another sin upon my head,
3113      By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3114      By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3115      For I come hither arm'd against myself:3005
3116      Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3117      A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3118      Paris. I do defy thy conjurations,
3119      And apprehend thee for a felon here.

3121      [They fight]

3122      Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3123      [Exit]

3124      Paris. O, I am slain!
3125      [Falls]3015
3126      If thou be merciful,
3127      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3128      [Dies]

3129      Romeo. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3130      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!3020
3131      What said my man, when my betossed soul
3132      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3133      He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3134      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3135      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,3025
3136      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3137      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3138      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3139      A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3140      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes3030
3141      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3142      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3143      [Laying PARIS in the tomb]
3144      How oft when men are at the point of death
3145      Have they been merry! which their keepers call3035
3146      A lightning before death: O, how may I
3147      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3148      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3149      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
3150      Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet3040
3151      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3152      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3153      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3154      O, what more favour can I do to thee,
3155      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain3045
3156      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3157      Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
3158      Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
3159      That unsubstantial death is amorous,
3160      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps3050
3161      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3162      For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
3163      And never from this palace of dim night
3164      Depart again: here, here will I remain
3165      With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here3055
3166      Will I set up my everlasting rest,
3167      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3168      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3169      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3170      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss3060
3171      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3172      Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
3173      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3174      The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
3175      Here's to my love!3065
3176      [Drinks]
3177      O true apothecary!
3178      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
3179      [Dies]
3180      [Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR]3070
3181      LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
3182      Friar Laurence. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3183      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
3184      Balthasar. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
3185      Friar Laurence. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,3075
3186      What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3187      To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3188      It burneth in the Capel's monument.
3189      Balthasar. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3190      One that you love.3080
3191      Friar Laurence. Who is it?
3192      Balthasar. Romeo.
3193      Friar Laurence. How long hath he been there?
3194      Balthasar. Full half an hour.
3195      Friar Laurence. Go with me to the vault.3085
3196      Balthasar. I dare not, sir
3197      My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3198      And fearfully did menace me with death,
3199      If I did stay to look on his intents.
3200      Friar Laurence. Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:3090
3201      O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
3202      Balthasar. As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3203      I dreamt my master and another fought,
3204      And that my master slew him.
3205      Friar Laurence. Romeo!3095
3206      [Advances]
3207      Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3208      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3209      What mean these masterless and gory swords
3210      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?3100
3211      [Enters the tomb]
3212      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3213      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3214      Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3215      The lady stirs.3105
3216      [JULIET wakes]

3217      Juliet. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3218      I do remember well where I should be,
3219      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
3220      [Noise within]

3221      Friar Laurence. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3222      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3223      A greater power than we can contradict
3224      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3225      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;3115
3226      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3227      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3228      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3229      Come, go, good Juliet,
3230      [Noise again]3120
3231      I dare no longer stay.
3232      Juliet. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3233      [Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
3234      What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3235      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:3125
3236      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3237      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3238      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3239      To make die with a restorative.
3240      [Kisses him]3130
3241      Thy lips are warm.
3242      First Watchman. [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
3243      Juliet. Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3244      [Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
3245      This is thy sheath;3135
3246      [Stabs herself]
3247      there rust, and let me die.
3248      [Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]

3249      [Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]

3250      Page. This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.3140
3251      First Watchman. The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3252      Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3253      Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3254      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3255      Who here hath lain these two days buried.3145
3256      Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3257      Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3258      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3259      But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3260      We cannot without circumstance descry.3150
3261      [Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]

3262      Second Watchman. Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
3263      First Watchman. Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
3264      [Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]

3265      Third Watchman. Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:3155
3266      We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3267      As he was coming from this churchyard side.
3268      First Watchman. A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
3269      [Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]

3270      Prince Escalus. What misadventure is so early up,3160
3271      That calls our person from our morning's rest?
3272      [Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]

3273      Capulet. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
3274      Lady Capulet. The people in the street cry Romeo,
3275      Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,3165
3276      With open outcry toward our monument.
3277      Prince Escalus. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
3278      First Watchman. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
3279      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
3280      Warm and new kill'd.3170
3281      Prince Escalus. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
3282      First Watchman. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
3283      With instruments upon them, fit to open
3284      These dead men's tombs.
3285      Capulet. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!3175
3286      This dagger hath mista'en—for, lo, his house
3287      Is empty on the back of Montague,—
3288      And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
3289      Lady Capulet. O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
3290      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.3180
3291      [Enter MONTAGUE and others]

3292      Prince Escalus. Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
3293      To see thy son and heir more early down.
3294      Montague. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
3295      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:3185
3296      What further woe conspires against mine age?
3297      Prince Escalus. Look, and thou shalt see.
3298      Montague. O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
3299      To press before thy father to a grave?
3300      Prince Escalus. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,3190
3301      Till we can clear these ambiguities,
3302      And know their spring, their head, their
3303      true descent;
3304      And then will I be general of your woes,
3305      And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,3195
3306      And let mischance be slave to patience.
3307      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
3308      Friar Laurence. I am the greatest, able to do least,
3309      Yet most suspected, as the time and place
3310      Doth make against me of this direful murder;3200
3311      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
3312      Myself condemned and myself excused.
3313      Prince Escalus. Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
3314      Friar Laurence. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
3315      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.3205
3316      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
3317      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
3318      I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
3319      Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
3320      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,3210
3321      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
3322      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
3323      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
3324      To County Paris: then comes she to me,
3325      And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean3215
3326      To rid her from this second marriage,
3327      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
3328      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
3329      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
3330      As I intended, for it wrought on her3220
3331      The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
3332      That he should hither come as this dire night,
3333      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
3334      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
3335      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,3225
3336      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
3337      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
3338      At the prefixed hour of her waking,
3339      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
3340      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,3230
3341      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
3342      But when I came, some minute ere the time
3343      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
3344      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
3345      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,3235
3346      And bear this work of heaven with patience:
3347      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
3348      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
3349      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
3350      All this I know; and to the marriage3240
3351      Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
3352      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
3353      Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
3354      Unto the rigour of severest law.
3355      Prince Escalus. We still have known thee for a holy man.3245
3356      Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
3357      Balthasar. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
3358      And then in post he came from Mantua
3359      To this same place, to this same monument.
3360      This letter he early bid me give his father,3250
3361      And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
3362      I departed not and left him there.
3363      Prince Escalus. Give me the letter; I will look on it.
3364      Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
3365      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?3255
3366      Page. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
3367      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
3368      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
3369      And by and by my master drew on him;
3370      And then I ran away to call the watch.3260
3371      Prince Escalus. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
3372      Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
3373      And here he writes that he did buy a poison
3374      Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
3375      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.3265
3376      Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
3377      See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
3378      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
3379      And I for winking at your discords too
3380      Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.3270
3381      Capulet. O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
3382      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
3383      Can I demand.
3384      Montague. But I can give thee more:
3385      For I will raise her statue in pure gold;3275
3386      That while Verona by that name is known,
3387      There shall no figure at such rate be set
3388      As that of true and faithful Juliet.
3389      Capulet. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
3390      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!3280
3391      Prince Escalus. A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
3392      The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
3393      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
3394      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
3395      For never was a story of more woe3285
3396      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
3397      [Exeunt]
3398      Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
3399      Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
3400      The which if you with patient ears attend,
3401      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
3402      SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
3403      Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
3404      SAMPSON
3405      Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
3406      GREGORY
3407      No, for then we should be colliers.
3408      SAMPSON
3409      I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
3410      GREGORY
3411      Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
3412      SAMPSON
3413      I strike quickly, being moved.
3414      GREGORY
3415      But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
3416      SAMPSON
3417      A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
3418      GREGORY
3419      To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
3420      therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
3421      SAMPSON
3422      A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
3423      take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
3424      GREGORY
3425      That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
3426      to the wall.
3427      SAMPSON
3428      True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
3429      are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
3430      Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
3431      to the wall.
3432      GREGORY
3433      The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
3434      SAMPSON
3435      'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
3436      have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
3437      maids, and cut off their heads.
3438      GREGORY
3439      The heads of the maids?
3440      SAMPSON
3441      Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
3442      take it in what sense thou wilt.
3443      GREGORY
3444      They must take it in sense that feel it.
3445      SAMPSON
3446      Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
3447      'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
3448      GREGORY
3449      'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
3450      hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
3451      two of the house of the Montagues.
3452      SAMPSON
3453      My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
3454      GREGORY
3455      How! turn thy back and run?
3456      SAMPSON
3457      Fear me not.
3458      GREGORY
3459      No, marry; I fear thee!
3460      SAMPSON
3461      Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
3462      GREGORY
3463      I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
3464      they list.
3465      SAMPSON
3466      Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
3467      which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
3468      Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

3469      ABRAHAM
3470      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
3471      SAMPSON
3472      I do bite my thumb, sir.
3473      ABRAHAM
3474      Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
3475      SAMPSON
3476      [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
3477      ay?
3478      GREGORY
3479      No.
3480      SAMPSON
3481      No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
3482      bite my thumb, sir.
3483      GREGORY
3484      Do you quarrel, sir?
3485      ABRAHAM
3486      Quarrel sir! no, sir.
3487      SAMPSON
3488      If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
3489      ABRAHAM
3490      No better.
3491      SAMPSON
3492      Well, sir.
3493      GREGORY
3494      Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
3495      SAMPSON
3496      Yes, better, sir.
3497      ABRAHAM
3498      You lie.
3499      SAMPSON
3500      Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
3501      They fight

3502      Enter BENVOLIO

3503      BENVOLIO
3504      Part, fools!
3505      Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
3506      Beats down their swords

3507      Enter TYBALT

3508      TYBALT
3509      What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
3510      Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
3511      BENVOLIO
3512      I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
3513      Or manage it to part these men with me.
3514      TYBALT
3515      What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
3516      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
3517      Have at thee, coward!
3518      They fight

3519      Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

3520      First Citizen
3521      Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
3522      Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
3523      Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

3524      CAPULET
3525      What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
3526      LADY CAPULET
3527      A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
3528      CAPULET
3529      My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
3530      And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
3531      Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

3532      MONTAGUE
3533      Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
3534      LADY MONTAGUE
3535      Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
3536      Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

3537      PRINCE
3538      Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
3539      Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
3540      Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
3541      That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
3542      With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
3543      On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
3544      Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
3545      And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
3546      Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
3547      By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
3548      Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
3549      And made Verona's ancient citizens
3550      Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
3551      To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
3552      Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
3553      If ever you disturb our streets again,
3554      Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
3555      For this time, all the rest depart away:
3556      You Capulet; shall go along with me:
3557      And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
3558      To know our further pleasure in this case,
3559      To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
3560      Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
3561      Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

3562      MONTAGUE
3563      Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
3564      Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
3565      BENVOLIO
3566      Here were the servants of your adversary,
3567      And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
3568      I drew to part them: in the instant came
3569      The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
3570      Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
3571      He swung about his head and cut the winds,
3572      Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
3573      While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
3574      Came more and more and fought on part and part,
3575      Till the prince came, who parted either part.
3576      LADY MONTAGUE
3577      O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
3578      Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
3579      BENVOLIO
3580      Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
3581      Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
3582      A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
3583      Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
3584      That westward rooteth from the city's side,
3585      So early walking did I see your son:
3586      Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
3587      And stole into the covert of the wood:
3588      I, measuring his affections by my own,
3589      That most are busied when they're most alone,
3590      Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
3591      And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
3592      MONTAGUE
3593      Many a morning hath he there been seen,
3594      With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
3595      Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
3596      But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
3597      Should in the furthest east begin to draw
3598      The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
3599      Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
3600      And private in his chamber pens himself,
3601      Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
3602      And makes himself an artificial night:
3603      Black and portentous must this humour prove,
3604      Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
3605      BENVOLIO
3606      My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
3607      MONTAGUE
3608      I neither know it nor can learn of him.
3609      BENVOLIO
3610      Have you importuned him by any means?
3611      MONTAGUE
3612      Both by myself and many other friends:
3613      But he, his own affections' counsellor,
3614      Is to himself--I will not say how true--
3615      But to himself so secret and so close,
3616      So far from sounding and discovery,
3617      As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
3618      Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
3619      Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
3620      Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
3621      We would as willingly give cure as know.
3622      Enter ROMEO

3623      BENVOLIO
3624      See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
3625      I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
3626      MONTAGUE
3627      I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
3628      To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
3629      Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

3630      BENVOLIO
3631      Good-morrow, cousin.
3632      ROMEO
3633      Is the day so young?
3634      BENVOLIO
3635      But new struck nine.
3636      ROMEO
3637      Ay me! sad hours seem long.
3638      Was that my father that went hence so fast?
3639      BENVOLIO
3640      It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
3641      ROMEO
3642      Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
3643      BENVOLIO
3644      In love?
3645      ROMEO
3646      Out--
3647      BENVOLIO
3648      Of love?
3649      ROMEO
3650      Out of her favour, where I am in love.
3651      BENVOLIO
3652      Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
3653      Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
3654      ROMEO
3655      Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
3656      Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
3657      Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
3658      Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
3659      Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
3660      Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
3661      O any thing, of nothing first create!
3662      O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
3663      Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
3664      Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
3665      sick health!
3666      Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
3667      This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
3668      Dost thou not laugh?
3669      BENVOLIO
3670      No, coz, I rather weep.
3671      ROMEO
3672      Good heart, at what?
3673      BENVOLIO
3674      At thy good heart's oppression.
3675      ROMEO
3676      Why, such is love's transgression.
3677      Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
3678      Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
3679      With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
3680      Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
3681      Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
3682      Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
3683      Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
3684      What is it else? a madness most discreet,
3685      A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
3686      Farewell, my coz.
3687      BENVOLIO
3688      Soft! I will go along;
3689      An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
3690      ROMEO
3691      Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
3692      This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
3693      BENVOLIO
3694      Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
3695      ROMEO
3696      What, shall I groan and tell thee?
3697      BENVOLIO
3698      Groan! why, no.
3699      But sadly tell me who.
3700      ROMEO
3701      Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
3702      Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
3703      In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
3704      BENVOLIO
3705      I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
3706      ROMEO
3707      A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
3708      BENVOLIO
3709      A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
3710      ROMEO
3711      Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
3712      With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
3713      And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
3714      From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
3715      She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
3716      Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
3717      Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
3718      O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
3719      That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
3720      BENVOLIO
3721      Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
3722      ROMEO
3723      She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
3724      For beauty starved with her severity
3725      Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
3726      She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
3727      To merit bliss by making me despair:
3728      She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
3729      Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
3730      BENVOLIO
3731      Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
3732      ROMEO
3733      O, teach me how I should forget to think.
3734      BENVOLIO
3735      By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
3736      Examine other beauties.
3737      ROMEO
3738      'Tis the way
3739      To call hers exquisite, in question more:
3740      These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
3741      Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
3742      He that is strucken blind cannot forget
3743      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
3744      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
3745      What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
3746      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
3747      Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
3748      BENVOLIO
3749      I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
3750      Exeunt

3751      SCENE II. A street.
3752      Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
3753      CAPULET
3754      But Montague is bound as well as I,
3755      In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
3756      For men so old as we to keep the peace.
3757      PARIS
3758      Of honourable reckoning are you both;
3759      And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
3760      But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
3761      CAPULET
3762      But saying o'er what I have said before:
3763      My child is yet a stranger in the world;
3764      She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
3765      Let two more summers wither in their pride,
3766      Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
3767      PARIS
3768      Younger than she are happy mothers made.
3769      CAPULET
3770      And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
3771      The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
3772      She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
3773      But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
3774      My will to her consent is but a part;
3775      An she agree, within her scope of choice
3776      Lies my consent and fair according voice.
3777      This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
3778      Whereto I have invited many a guest,
3779      Such as I love; and you, among the store,
3780      One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
3781      At my poor house look to behold this night
3782      Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
3783      Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
3784      When well-apparell'd April on the heel
3785      Of limping winter treads, even such delight
3786      Among fresh female buds shall you this night
3787      Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
3788      And like her most whose merit most shall be:
3789      Which on more view, of many mine being one
3790      May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
3791      Come, go with me.
3792      To Servant, giving a paper

3793      Go, sirrah, trudge about
3794      Through fair Verona; find those persons out
3795      Whose names are written there, and to them say,
3796      My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
3797      Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

3798      Servant
3799      Find them out whose names are written here! It is
3800      written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
3801      yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
3802      his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
3803      sent to find those persons whose names are here
3804      writ, and can never find what names the writing
3805      person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
3806      Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

3807      BENVOLIO
3808      Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
3809      One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
3810      Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
3811      One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
3812      Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
3813      And the rank poison of the old will die.
3814      ROMEO
3815      Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
3816      BENVOLIO
3817      For what, I pray thee?
3818      ROMEO
3819      For your broken shin.
3820      BENVOLIO
3821      Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
3822      ROMEO
3823      Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
3824      Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
3825      Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
3826      Servant
3827      God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
3828      ROMEO
3829      Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
3830      Servant
3831      Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
3832      pray, can you read any thing you see?
3833      ROMEO
3834      Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
3835      Servant
3836      Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
3837      ROMEO
3838      Stay, fellow; I can read.
3839      Reads

3840      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
3841      County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
3842      widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
3843      nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
3844      uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
3845      Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
3846      Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
3847      assembly: whither should they come?
3848      Servant
3849      Up.
3850      ROMEO
3851      Whither?
3852      Servant
3853      To supper; to our house.
3854      ROMEO
3855      Whose house?
3856      Servant
3857      My master's.
3858      ROMEO
3859      Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
3860      Servant
3861      Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
3862      great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
3863      of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
3864      Rest you merry!
3865      Exit

3866      BENVOLIO
3867      At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
3868      Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
3869      With all the admired beauties of Verona:
3870      Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
3871      Compare her face with some that I shall show,
3872      And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
3873      ROMEO
3874      When the devout religion of mine eye
3875      Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
3876      And these, who often drown'd could never die,
3877      Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
3878      One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
3879      Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
3880      BENVOLIO
3881      Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
3882      Herself poised with herself in either eye:
3883      But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
3884      Your lady's love against some other maid
3885      That I will show you shining at this feast,
3886      And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
3887      ROMEO
3888      I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
3889      But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
3890      Exeunt

3891      SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
3892      Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3893      LADY CAPULET
3894      Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
3895      Nurse
3896      Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
3897      I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
3898      God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
3899      Enter JULIET

3900      JULIET
3901      How now! who calls?
3902      Nurse
3903      Your mother.
3904      JULIET
3905      Madam, I am here.
3906      What is your will?
3907      LADY CAPULET
3908      This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
3909      We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
3910      I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
3911      Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
3912      Nurse
3913      Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
3914      LADY CAPULET
3915      She's not fourteen.
3916      Nurse
3917      I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
3918      And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
3919      She is not fourteen. How long is it now
3920      To Lammas-tide?
3921      LADY CAPULET
3922      A fortnight and odd days.
3923      Nurse
3924      Even or odd, of all days in the year,
3925      Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
3926      Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
3927      Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
3928      She was too good for me: but, as I said,
3929      On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
3930      That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
3931      'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
3932      And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
3933      Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
3934      For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
3935      Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
3936      My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
3937      Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
3938      When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
3939      Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
3940      To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
3941      Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
3942      To bid me trudge:
3943      And since that time it is eleven years;
3944      For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
3945      She could have run and waddled all about;
3946      For even the day before, she broke her brow:
3947      And then my husband--God be with his soul!
3948      A' was a merry man--took up the child:
3949      'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
3950      Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
3951      Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
3952      The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
3953      To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
3954      I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
3955      I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
3956      And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
3957      LADY CAPULET
3958      Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
3959      Nurse
3960      Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
3961      To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
3962      And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
3963      A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
3964      A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
3965      'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
3966      Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
3967      Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
3968      JULIET
3969      And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
3970      Nurse
3971      Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
3972      Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
3973      An I might live to see thee married once,
3974      I have my wish.
3975      LADY CAPULET
3976      Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
3977      I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
3978      How stands your disposition to be married?
3979      JULIET
3980      It is an honour that I dream not of.
3981      Nurse
3982      An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
3983      I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
3984      LADY CAPULET
3985      Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
3986      Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
3987      Are made already mothers: by my count,
3988      I was your mother much upon these years
3989      That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
3990      The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
3991      Nurse
3992      A man, young lady! lady, such a man
3993      As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
3994      LADY CAPULET
3995      Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
3996      Nurse
3997      Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
3998      LADY CAPULET
3999      What say you? can you love the gentleman?
4000      This night you shall behold him at our feast;
4001      Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
4002      And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
4003      Examine every married lineament,
4004      And see how one another lends content
4005      And what obscured in this fair volume lies
4006      Find written in the margent of his eyes.
4007      This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
4008      To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
4009      The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
4010      For fair without the fair within to hide:
4011      That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
4012      That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
4013      So shall you share all that he doth possess,
4014      By having him, making yourself no less.
4015      Nurse
4016      No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
4017      LADY CAPULET
4018      Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
4019      JULIET
4020      I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
4021      But no more deep will I endart mine eye
4022      Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
4023      Enter a Servant

4024      Servant
4025      Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
4026      called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
4027      the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
4028      hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
4029      LADY CAPULET
4030      We follow thee.
4031      Exit Servant

4032      Juliet, the county stays.
4033      Nurse
4034      Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
4035      Exeunt

4036      SCENE IV. A street.
4037      Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
4038      ROMEO
4039      What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
4040      Or shall we on without a apology?
4041      BENVOLIO
4042      The date is out of such prolixity:
4043      We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
4044      Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
4045      Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
4046      Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
4047      After the prompter, for our entrance:
4048      But let them measure us by what they will;
4049      We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
4050      ROMEO
4051      Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
4052      Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
4053      MERCUTIO
4054      Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
4055      ROMEO
4056      Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
4057      With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
4058      So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
4059      MERCUTIO
4060      You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
4061      And soar with them above a common bound.
4062      ROMEO
4063      I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
4064      To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
4065      I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
4066      Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
4067      MERCUTIO
4068      And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
4069      Too great oppression for a tender thing.
4070      ROMEO
4071      Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
4072      Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
4073      MERCUTIO
4074      If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
4075      Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
4076      Give me a case to put my visage in:
4077      A visor for a visor! what care I
4078      What curious eye doth quote deformities?
4079      Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
4080      BENVOLIO
4081      Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
4082      But every man betake him to his legs.
4083      ROMEO
4084      A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
4085      Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
4086      For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
4087      I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
4088      The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
4089      MERCUTIO
4090      Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
4091      If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
4092      Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
4093      Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
4094      ROMEO
4095      Nay, that's not so.
4096      MERCUTIO
4097      I mean, sir, in delay
4098      We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
4099      Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
4100      Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
4101      ROMEO
4102      And we mean well in going to this mask;
4103      But 'tis no wit to go.
4104      MERCUTIO
4105      Why, may one ask?
4106      ROMEO
4107      I dream'd a dream to-night.
4108      MERCUTIO
4109      And so did I.
4110      ROMEO
4111      Well, what was yours?
4112      MERCUTIO
4113      That dreamers often lie.
4114      ROMEO
4115      In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
4116      MERCUTIO
4117      O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
4118      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
4119      In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
4120      On the fore-finger of an alderman,
4121      Drawn with a team of little atomies
4122      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
4123      Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
4124      The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
4125      The traces of the smallest spider's web,
4126      The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
4127      Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
4128      Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
4129      Not so big as a round little worm
4130      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
4131      Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
4132      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
4133      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
4134      And in this state she gallops night by night
4135      Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
4136      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
4137      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
4138      O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
4139      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
4140      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
4141      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
4142      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
4143      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
4144      Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
4145      Then dreams, he of another benefice:
4146      Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
4147      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
4148      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
4149      Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
4150      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
4151      And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
4152      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
4153      That plats the manes of horses in the night,
4154      And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
4155      Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
4156      This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
4157      That presses them and learns them first to bear,
4158      Making them women of good carriage:
4159      This is she--
4160      ROMEO
4161      Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
4162      Thou talk'st of nothing.
4163      MERCUTIO
4164      True, I talk of dreams,
4165      Which are the children of an idle brain,
4166      Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
4167      Which is as thin of substance as the air
4168      And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
4169      Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
4170      And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
4171      Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
4172      BENVOLIO
4173      This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
4174      Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
4175      ROMEO
4176      I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
4177      Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
4178      Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
4179      With this night's revels and expire the term
4180      Of a despised life closed in my breast
4181      By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
4182      But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
4183      Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
4184      BENVOLIO
4185      Strike, drum.
4186      Exeunt

4187      SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
4188      Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
4189      First Servant
4190      Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
4191      shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
4192      Second Servant
4193      When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
4194      hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
4195      First Servant
4196      Away with the joint-stools, remove the
4197      court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
4198      me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
4199      the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
4200      Antony, and Potpan!
4201      Second Servant
4202      Ay, boy, ready.
4203      First Servant
4204      You are looked for and called for, asked for and
4205      sought for, in the great chamber.
4206      Second Servant
4207      We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
4208      brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
4209      Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

4210      CAPULET
4211      Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
4212      Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
4213      Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
4214      Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
4215      She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
4216      Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
4217      That I have worn a visor and could tell
4218      A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
4219      Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
4220      You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
4221      A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
4222      Music plays, and they dance

4223      More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
4224      And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
4225      Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
4226      Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
4227      For you and I are past our dancing days:
4228      How long is't now since last yourself and I
4229      Were in a mask?
4230      Second Capulet
4231      By'r lady, thirty years.
4232      CAPULET
4233      What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
4234      'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
4235      Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
4236      Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
4237      Second Capulet
4238      'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
4239      His son is thirty.
4240      CAPULET
4241      Will you tell me that?
4242      His son was but a ward two years ago.
4243      ROMEO
4244      [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
4245      enrich the hand
4246      Of yonder knight?
4247      Servant
4248      I know not, sir.
4249      ROMEO
4250      O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
4251      It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
4252      Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
4253      Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
4254      So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
4255      As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
4256      The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
4257      And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
4258      Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
4259      For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
4260      TYBALT
4261      This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
4262      Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
4263      Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
4264      To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
4265      Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
4266      To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
4267      CAPULET
4268      Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
4269      TYBALT
4270      Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
4271      A villain that is hither come in spite,
4272      To scorn at our solemnity this night.
4273      CAPULET
4274      Young Romeo is it?
4275      TYBALT
4276      'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
4277      CAPULET
4278      Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
4279      He bears him like a portly gentleman;
4280      And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
4281      To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
4282      I would not for the wealth of all the town
4283      Here in my house do him disparagement:
4284      Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
4285      It is my will, the which if thou respect,
4286      Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
4287      And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
4288      TYBALT
4289      It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
4290      I'll not endure him.
4291      CAPULET
4292      He shall be endured:
4293      What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
4294      Am I the master here, or you? go to.
4295      You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
4296      You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
4297      You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
4298      TYBALT
4299      Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
4300      CAPULET
4301      Go to, go to;
4302      You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
4303      This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
4304      You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
4305      Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
4306      Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
4307      I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
4308      TYBALT
4309      Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
4310      Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
4311      I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
4312      Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
4313      Exit

4314      ROMEO
4315      [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
4316      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
4317      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
4318      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
4319      JULIET
4320      Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
4321      Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
4322      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
4323      And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
4324      ROMEO
4325      Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
4326      JULIET
4327      Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
4328      ROMEO
4329      O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
4330      They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
4331      JULIET
4332      Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
4333      ROMEO
4334      Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
4335      Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
4336      JULIET
4337      Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
4338      ROMEO
4339      Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
4340      Give me my sin again.
4341      JULIET
4342      You kiss by the book.
4343      Nurse
4344      Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
4345      ROMEO
4346      What is her mother?
4347      Nurse
4348      Marry, bachelor,
4349      Her mother is the lady of the house,
4350      And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
4351      I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
4352      I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
4353      Shall have the chinks.
4354      ROMEO
4355      Is she a Capulet?
4356      O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
4357      BENVOLIO
4358      Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
4359      ROMEO
4360      Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
4361      CAPULET
4362      Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
4363      We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
4364      Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
4365      I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
4366      More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
4367      Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
4368      I'll to my rest.
4369      Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

4370      JULIET
4371      Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
4372      Nurse
4373      The son and heir of old Tiberio.
4374      JULIET
4375      What's he that now is going out of door?
4376      Nurse
4377      Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
4378      JULIET
4379      What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
4380      Nurse
4381      I know not.
4382      JULIET
4383      Go ask his name: if he be married.
4384      My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
4385      Nurse
4386      His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
4387      The only son of your great enemy.
4388      JULIET
4389      My only love sprung from my only hate!
4390      Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
4391      Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
4392      That I must love a loathed enemy.
4393      Nurse
4394      What's this? what's this?
4395      JULIET
4396      A rhyme I learn'd even now
4397      Of one I danced withal.
4398      One calls within 'Juliet.'

4399      Nurse
4400      Anon, anon!
4401      Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
4402      Exeunt

4403      ACT II
4404      PROLOGUE
4405      Enter Chorus
4406      Chorus
4407      Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
4408      And young affection gapes to be his heir;
4409      That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
4410      With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
4411      Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
4412      Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
4413      But to his foe supposed he must complain,
4414      And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
4415      Being held a foe, he may not have access
4416      To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
4417      And she as much in love, her means much less
4418      To meet her new-beloved any where:
4419      But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
4420      Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
4421      Exit

4422      SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
4423      Enter ROMEO
4424      ROMEO
4425      Can I go forward when my heart is here?
4426      Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
4427      He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

4428      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

4429      BENVOLIO
4430      Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
4431      MERCUTIO
4432      He is wise;
4433      And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
4434      BENVOLIO
4435      He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
4436      Call, good Mercutio.
4437      MERCUTIO
4438      Nay, I'll conjure too.
4439      Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
4440      Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
4441      Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
4442      Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
4443      Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
4444      One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
4445      Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
4446      When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
4447      He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
4448      The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
4449      I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
4450      By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
4451      By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
4452      And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
4453      That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
4454      BENVOLIO
4455      And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
4456      MERCUTIO
4457      This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
4458      To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
4459      Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
4460      Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
4461      That were some spite: my invocation
4462      Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
4463      I conjure only but to raise up him.
4464      BENVOLIO
4465      Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
4466      To be consorted with the humorous night:
4467      Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
4468      MERCUTIO
4469      If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
4470      Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
4471      And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
4472      As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
4473      Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
4474      An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
4475      Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
4476      This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
4477      Come, shall we go?
4478      BENVOLIO
4479      Go, then; for 'tis in vain
4480      To seek him here that means not to be found.
4481      Exeunt

4482      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
4483      Enter ROMEO
4484      ROMEO
4485      He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
4486      JULIET appears above at a window

4487      But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
4488      It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
4489      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
4490      Who is already sick and pale with grief,
4491      That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
4492      Be not her maid, since she is envious;
4493      Her vestal livery is but sick and green
4494      And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
4495      It is my lady, O, it is my love!
4496      O, that she knew she were!
4497      She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
4498      Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
4499      I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
4500      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
4501      Having some business, do entreat her eyes
4502      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
4503      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
4504      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
4505      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
4506      Would through the airy region stream so bright
4507      That birds would sing and think it were not night.
4508      See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
4509      O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
4510      That I might touch that cheek!
4511      JULIET
4512      Ay me!
4513      ROMEO
4514      She speaks:
4515      O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
4516      As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
4517      As is a winged messenger of heaven
4518      Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
4519      Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
4520      When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
4521      And sails upon the bosom of the air.
4522      JULIET
4523      O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
4524      Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
4525      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
4526      And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
4527      ROMEO
4528      [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
4529      JULIET
4530      'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
4531      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
4532      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
4533      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
4534      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
4535      What's in a name? that which we call a rose
4536      By any other name would smell as sweet;
4537      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
4538      Retain that dear perfection which he owes
4539      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
4540      And for that name which is no part of thee
4541      Take all myself.
4542      ROMEO
4543      I take thee at thy word:
4544      Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
4545      Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
4546      JULIET
4547      What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
4548      So stumblest on my counsel?
4549      ROMEO
4550      By a name
4551      I know not how to tell thee who I am:
4552      My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
4553      Because it is an enemy to thee;
4554      Had I it written, I would tear the word.
4555      JULIET
4556      My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
4557      Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
4558      Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
4559      ROMEO
4560      Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
4561      JULIET
4562      How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
4563      The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
4564      And the place death, considering who thou art,
4565      If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
4566      ROMEO
4567      With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
4568      For stony limits cannot hold love out,
4569      And what love can do that dares love attempt;
4570      Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
4571      JULIET
4572      If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
4573      ROMEO
4574      Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
4575      Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
4576      And I am proof against their enmity.
4577      JULIET
4578      I would not for the world they saw thee here.
4579      ROMEO
4580      I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
4581      And but thou love me, let them find me here:
4582      My life were better ended by their hate,
4583      Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
4584      JULIET
4585      By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
4586      ROMEO
4587      By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
4588      He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
4589      I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
4590      As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
4591      I would adventure for such merchandise.
4592      JULIET
4593      Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
4594      Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
4595      For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
4596      Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
4597      What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
4598      Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
4599      And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
4600      Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
4601      Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
4602      If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
4603      Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
4604      I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
4605      So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
4606      In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
4607      And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
4608      But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
4609      Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
4610      I should have been more strange, I must confess,
4611      But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
4612      My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
4613      And not impute this yielding to light love,
4614      Which the dark night hath so discovered.
4615      ROMEO
4616      Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
4617      That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
4618      JULIET
4619      O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
4620      That monthly changes in her circled orb,
4621      Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
4622      ROMEO
4623      What shall I swear by?
4624      JULIET
4625      Do not swear at all;
4626      Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
4627      Which is the god of my idolatry,
4628      And I'll believe thee.
4629      ROMEO
4630      If my heart's dear love--
4631      JULIET
4632      Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
4633      I have no joy of this contract to-night:
4634      It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
4635      Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
4636      Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
4637      This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
4638      May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
4639      Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
4640      Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
4641      ROMEO
4642      O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
4643      JULIET
4644      What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
4645      ROMEO
4646      The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
4647      JULIET
4648      I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
4649      And yet I would it were to give again.
4650      ROMEO
4651      Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
4652      JULIET
4653      But to be frank, and give it thee again.
4654      And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
4655      My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
4656      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
4657      The more I have, for both are infinite.
4658      Nurse calls within

4659      I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
4660      Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
4661      Stay but a little, I will come again.
4662      Exit, above

4663      ROMEO
4664      O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
4665      Being in night, all this is but a dream,
4666      Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
4667      Re-enter JULIET, above

4668      JULIET
4669      Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
4670      If that thy bent of love be honourable,
4671      Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
4672      By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
4673      Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
4674      And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
4675      And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
4676      Nurse
4677      [Within] Madam!
4678      JULIET
4679      I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
4680      I do beseech thee--
4681      Nurse
4682      [Within] Madam!
4683      JULIET
4684      By and by, I come:--
4685      To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
4686      To-morrow will I send.
4687      ROMEO
4688      So thrive my soul--
4689      JULIET
4690      A thousand times good night!
4691      Exit, above

4692      ROMEO
4693      A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
4694      Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
4695      their books,
4696      But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
4697      Retiring

4698      Re-enter JULIET, above

4699      JULIET
4700      Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
4701      To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
4702      Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
4703      Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
4704      And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
4705      With repetition of my Romeo's name.
4706      ROMEO
4707      It is my soul that calls upon my name:
4708      How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
4709      Like softest music to attending ears!
4710      JULIET
4711      Romeo!
4712      ROMEO
4713      My dear?
4714      JULIET
4715      At what o'clock to-morrow
4716      Shall I send to thee?
4717      ROMEO
4718      At the hour of nine.
4719      JULIET
4720      I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
4721      I have forgot why I did call thee back.
4722      ROMEO
4723      Let me stand here till thou remember it.
4724      JULIET
4725      I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
4726      Remembering how I love thy company.
4727      ROMEO
4728      And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
4729      Forgetting any other home but this.
4730      JULIET
4731      'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
4732      And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
4733      Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
4734      Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
4735      And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
4736      So loving-jealous of his liberty.
4737      ROMEO
4738      I would I were thy bird.
4739      JULIET
4740      Sweet, so would I:
4741      Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
4742      Good night, good night! parting is such
4743      sweet sorrow,
4744      That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
4745      Exit above

4746      ROMEO
4747      Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
4748      Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
4749      Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
4750      His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
4751      Exit

4752      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
4753      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
4754      FRIAR LAURENCE
4755      The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
4756      Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
4757      And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
4758      From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
4759      Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
4760      The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
4761      I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
4762      With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
4763      The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
4764      What is her burying grave that is her womb,
4765      And from her womb children of divers kind
4766      We sucking on her natural bosom find,
4767      Many for many virtues excellent,
4768      None but for some and yet all different.
4769      O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
4770      In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
4771      For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
4772      But to the earth some special good doth give,
4773      Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
4774      Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
4775      Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
4776      And vice sometimes by action dignified.
4777      Within the infant rind of this small flower
4778      Poison hath residence and medicine power:
4779      For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
4780      Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
4781      Two such opposed kings encamp them still
4782      In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
4783      And where the worser is predominant,
4784      Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
4785      Enter ROMEO

4786      ROMEO
4787      Good morrow, father.
4788      FRIAR LAURENCE
4789      Benedicite!
4790      What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
4791      Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
4792      So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
4793      Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
4794      And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
4795      But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
4796      Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
4797      Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
4798      Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
4799      Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
4800      Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
4801      ROMEO
4802      That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
4803      FRIAR LAURENCE
4804      God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
4805      ROMEO
4806      With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
4807      I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
4808      FRIAR LAURENCE
4809      That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
4810      ROMEO
4811      I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
4812      I have been feasting with mine enemy,
4813      Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
4814      That's by me wounded: both our remedies
4815      Within thy help and holy physic lies:
4816      I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
4817      My intercession likewise steads my foe.
4818      FRIAR LAURENCE
4819      Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
4820      Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
4821      ROMEO
4822      Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
4823      On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
4824      As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
4825      And all combined, save what thou must combine
4826      By holy marriage: when and where and how
4827      We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
4828      I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
4829      That thou consent to marry us to-day.
4830      FRIAR LAURENCE
4831      Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
4832      Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
4833      So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
4834      Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
4835      Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
4836      Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
4837      How much salt water thrown away in waste,
4838      To season love, that of it doth not taste!
4839      The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
4840      Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
4841      Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
4842      Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
4843      If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
4844      Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
4845      And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
4846      Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
4847      ROMEO
4848      Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
4849      FRIAR LAURENCE
4850      For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
4851      ROMEO
4852      And bad'st me bury love.
4853      FRIAR LAURENCE
4854      Not in a grave,
4855      To lay one in, another out to have.
4856      ROMEO
4857      I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
4858      Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
4859      The other did not so.
4860      FRIAR LAURENCE
4861      O, she knew well
4862      Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
4863      But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
4864      In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
4865      For this alliance may so happy prove,
4866      To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
4867      ROMEO
4868      O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
4869      FRIAR LAURENCE
4870      Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
4871      Exeunt

4872      SCENE IV. A street.
4873      Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
4874      MERCUTIO
4875      Where the devil should this Romeo be?
4876      Came he not home to-night?
4877      BENVOLIO
4878      Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
4879      MERCUTIO
4880      Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
4881      Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
4882      BENVOLIO
4883      Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
4884      Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
4885      MERCUTIO
4886      A challenge, on my life.
4887      BENVOLIO
4888      Romeo will answer it.
4889      MERCUTIO
4890      Any man that can write may answer a letter.
4891      BENVOLIO
4892      Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
4893      dares, being dared.
4894      MERCUTIO
4895      Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
4896      white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
4897      love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
4898      blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
4899      encounter Tybalt?
4900      BENVOLIO
4901      Why, what is Tybalt?
4902      MERCUTIO
4903      More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
4904      the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
4905      you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
4906      proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
4907      the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
4908      button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
4909      very first house, of the first and second cause:
4910      ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
4911      hai!
4912      BENVOLIO
4913      The what?
4914      MERCUTIO
4915      The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
4916      fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
4917      a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
4918      whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
4919      grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
4920      these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
4921      perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
4922      that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
4923      bones, their bones!
4924      Enter ROMEO

4925      BENVOLIO
4926      Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
4927      MERCUTIO
4928      Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
4929      how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
4930      that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
4931      kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
4932      be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
4933      Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
4934      eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
4935      Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
4936      to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
4937      fairly last night.
4938      ROMEO
4939      Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
4940      MERCUTIO
4941      The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
4942      ROMEO
4943      Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
4944      such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
4945      MERCUTIO
4946      That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
4947      constrains a man to bow in the hams.
4948      ROMEO
4949      Meaning, to court'sy.
4950      MERCUTIO
4951      Thou hast most kindly hit it.
4952      ROMEO
4953      A most courteous exposition.
4954      MERCUTIO
4955      Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
4956      ROMEO
4957      Pink for flower.
4958      MERCUTIO
4959      Right.
4960      ROMEO
4961      Why, then is my pump well flowered.
4962      MERCUTIO
4963      Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
4964      worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
4965      is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
4966      ROMEO
4967      O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
4968      singleness.
4969      MERCUTIO
4970      Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
4971      ROMEO
4972      Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
4973      MERCUTIO
4974      Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
4975      done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
4976      thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
4977      was I with you there for the goose?
4978      ROMEO
4979      Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
4980      not there for the goose.
4981      MERCUTIO
4982      I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
4983      ROMEO
4984      Nay, good goose, bite not.
4985      MERCUTIO
4986      Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
4987      sharp sauce.
4988      ROMEO
4989      And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
4990      MERCUTIO
4991      O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
4992      inch narrow to an ell broad!
4993      ROMEO
4994      I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
4995      to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
4996      MERCUTIO
4997      Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
4998      now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
4999      thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
5000      for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
5001      that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
5002      BENVOLIO
5003      Stop there, stop there.
5004      MERCUTIO
5005      Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
5006      BENVOLIO
5007      Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
5008      MERCUTIO
5009      O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
5010      for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
5011      meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
5012      ROMEO
5013      Here's goodly gear!
5014      Enter Nurse and PETER

5015      MERCUTIO
5016      A sail, a sail!
5017      BENVOLIO
5018      Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
5019      Nurse
5020      Peter!
5021      PETER
5022      Anon!
5023      Nurse
5024      My fan, Peter.
5025      MERCUTIO
5026      Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
5027      fairer face.
5028      Nurse
5029      God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
5030      MERCUTIO
5031      God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
5032      Nurse
5033      Is it good den?
5034      MERCUTIO
5035      'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
5036      dial is now upon the prick of noon.
5037      Nurse
5038      Out upon you! what a man are you!
5039      ROMEO
5040      One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
5041      mar.
5042      Nurse
5043      By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
5044      quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
5045      may find the young Romeo?
5046      ROMEO
5047      I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
5048      you have found him than he was when you sought him:
5049      I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
5050      Nurse
5051      You say well.
5052      MERCUTIO
5053      Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
5054      wisely, wisely.
5055      Nurse
5056      if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
5057      you.
5058      BENVOLIO
5059      She will indite him to some supper.
5060      MERCUTIO
5061      A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
5062      ROMEO
5063      What hast thou found?
5064      MERCUTIO
5065      No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
5066      that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
5067      Sings

5068      An old hare hoar,
5069      And an old hare hoar,
5070      Is very good meat in lent
5071      But a hare that is hoar
5072      Is too much for a score,
5073      When it hoars ere it be spent.
5074      Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
5075      to dinner, thither.
5076      ROMEO
5077      I will follow you.
5078      MERCUTIO
5079      Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
5080      Singing

5081      'lady, lady, lady.'
5082      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

5083      Nurse
5084      Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
5085      merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
5086      ROMEO
5087      A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
5088      and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
5089      to in a month.
5090      Nurse
5091      An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
5092      down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
5093      Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
5094      Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
5095      none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
5096      too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
5097      PETER
5098      I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
5099      should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
5100      draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
5101      good quarrel, and the law on my side.
5102      Nurse
5103      Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
5104      me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
5105      and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
5106      out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
5107      but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
5108      a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
5109      kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
5110      is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
5111      with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
5112      to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
5113      ROMEO
5114      Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
5115      protest unto thee--
5116      Nurse
5117      Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
5118      Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
5119      ROMEO
5120      What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
5121      Nurse
5122      I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
5123      I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
5124      ROMEO
5125      Bid her devise
5126      Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
5127      And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
5128      Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
5129      Nurse
5130      No truly sir; not a penny.
5131      ROMEO
5132      Go to; I say you shall.
5133      Nurse
5134      This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
5135      ROMEO
5136      And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
5137      Within this hour my man shall be with thee
5138      And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
5139      Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
5140      Must be my convoy in the secret night.
5141      Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
5142      Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
5143      Nurse
5144      Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
5145      ROMEO
5146      What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
5147      Nurse
5148      Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
5149      Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
5150      ROMEO
5151      I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
5152      NURSE
5153      Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
5154      Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
5155      is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
5156      lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
5157      see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
5158      sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
5159      man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
5160      as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
5161      rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
5162      ROMEO
5163      Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
5164      Nurse
5165      Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
5166      the--No; I know it begins with some other
5167      letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
5168      it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
5169      to hear it.
5170      ROMEO
5171      Commend me to thy lady.
5172      Nurse
5173      Ay, a thousand times.
5174      Exit Romeo

5175      Peter!
5176      PETER
5177      Anon!
5178      Nurse
5179      Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
5180      Exeunt

5181      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
5182      Enter JULIET
5183      JULIET
5184      The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
5185      In half an hour she promised to return.
5186      Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
5187      O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
5188      Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
5189      Driving back shadows over louring hills:
5190      Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
5191      And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
5192      Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
5193      Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
5194      Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
5195      Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
5196      She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
5197      My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
5198      And his to me:
5199      But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
5200      Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
5201      O God, she comes!
5202      Enter Nurse and PETER

5203      O honey nurse, what news?
5204      Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
5205      Nurse
5206      Peter, stay at the gate.
5207      Exit PETER

5208      JULIET
5209      Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
5210      Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
5211      If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
5212      By playing it to me with so sour a face.
5213      Nurse
5214      I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
5215      Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
5216      JULIET
5217      I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
5218      Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
5219      Nurse
5220      Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
5221      Do you not see that I am out of breath?
5222      JULIET
5223      How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
5224      To say to me that thou art out of breath?
5225      The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
5226      Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
5227      Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
5228      Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
5229      Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
5230      Nurse
5231      Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
5232      how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
5233      face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
5234      all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
5235      though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
5236      past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
5237      but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
5238      ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
5239      JULIET
5240      No, no: but all this did I know before.
5241      What says he of our marriage? what of that?
5242      Nurse
5243      Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
5244      It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
5245      My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
5246      Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
5247      To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
5248      JULIET
5249      I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
5250      Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
5251      Nurse
5252      Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
5253      courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
5254      warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
5255      JULIET
5256      Where is my mother! why, she is within;
5257      Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
5258      'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
5259      Where is your mother?'
5260      Nurse
5261      O God's lady dear!
5262      Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
5263      Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
5264      Henceforward do your messages yourself.
5265      JULIET
5266      Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
5267      Nurse
5268      Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
5269      JULIET
5270      I have.
5271      Nurse
5272      Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
5273      There stays a husband to make you a wife:
5274      Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
5275      They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
5276      Hie you to church; I must another way,
5277      To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
5278      Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
5279      I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
5280      But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
5281      Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
5282      JULIET
5283      Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
5284      Exeunt

5285      SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
5286      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
5287      FRIAR LAURENCE
5288      So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
5289      That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
5290      ROMEO
5291      Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
5292      It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
5293      That one short minute gives me in her sight:
5294      Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
5295      Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
5296      It is enough I may but call her mine.
5297      FRIAR LAURENCE
5298      These violent delights have violent ends
5299      And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
5300      Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
5301      Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
5302      And in the taste confounds the appetite:
5303      Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
5304      Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
5305      Enter JULIET

5306      Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
5307      Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
5308      A lover may bestride the gossamer
5309      That idles in the wanton summer air,
5310      And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
5311      JULIET
5312      Good even to my ghostly confessor.
5313      FRIAR LAURENCE
5314      Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
5315      JULIET
5316      As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
5317      ROMEO
5318      Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
5319      Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
5320      To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
5321      This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
5322      Unfold the imagined happiness that both
5323      Receive in either by this dear encounter.
5324      JULIET
5325      Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
5326      Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
5327      They are but beggars that can count their worth;
5328      But my true love is grown to such excess
5329      I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
5330      FRIAR LAURENCE
5331      Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
5332      For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
5333      Till holy church incorporate two in one.
5334      Exeunt

5335      ACT III
5336      SCENE I. A public place.
5337      Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
5338      BENVOLIO
5339      I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
5340      The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
5341      And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
5342      For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
5343      MERCUTIO
5344      Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
5345      enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
5346      upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
5347      thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
5348      it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
5349      BENVOLIO
5350      Am I like such a fellow?
5351      MERCUTIO
5352      Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
5353      any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
5354      soon moody to be moved.
5355      BENVOLIO
5356      And what to?
5357      MERCUTIO
5358      Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
5359      shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
5360      thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
5361      or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
5362      wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
5363      other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
5364      eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
5365      Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
5366      meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
5367      an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
5368      man for coughing in the street, because he hath
5369      wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
5370      didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
5371      his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
5372      tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
5373      wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
5374      BENVOLIO
5375      An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
5376      should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
5377      MERCUTIO
5378      The fee-simple! O simple!
5379      BENVOLIO
5380      By my head, here come the Capulets.
5381      MERCUTIO
5382      By my heel, I care not.
5383      Enter TYBALT and others

5384      TYBALT
5385      Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
5386      Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
5387      MERCUTIO
5388      And but one word with one of us? couple it with
5389      something; make it a word and a blow.
5390      TYBALT
5391      You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
5392      will give me occasion.
5393      MERCUTIO
5394      Could you not take some occasion without giving?
5395      TYBALT
5396      Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
5397      MERCUTIO
5398      Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
5399      thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
5400      discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
5401      make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
5402      BENVOLIO
5403      We talk here in the public haunt of men:
5404      Either withdraw unto some private place,
5405      And reason coldly of your grievances,
5406      Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
5407      MERCUTIO
5408      Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
5409      I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
5410      Enter ROMEO

5411      TYBALT
5412      Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
5413      MERCUTIO
5414      But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
5415      Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
5416      Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
5417      TYBALT
5418      Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
5419      No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
5420      ROMEO
5421      Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
5422      Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
5423      To such a greeting: villain am I none;
5424      Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
5425      TYBALT
5426      Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
5427      That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
5428      ROMEO
5429      I do protest, I never injured thee,
5430      But love thee better than thou canst devise,
5431      Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
5432      And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
5433      As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
5434      MERCUTIO
5435      O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
5436      Alla stoccata carries it away.
5437      Draws

5438      Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
5439      TYBALT
5440      What wouldst thou have with me?
5441      MERCUTIO
5442      Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
5443      lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
5444      shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
5445      eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
5446      by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
5447      ears ere it be out.
5448      TYBALT
5449      I am for you.
5450      Drawing

5451      ROMEO
5452      Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
5453      MERCUTIO
5454      Come, sir, your passado.
5455      They fight

5456      ROMEO
5457      Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
5458      Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
5459      Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
5460      Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
5461      Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
5462      TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

5463      MERCUTIO
5464      I am hurt.
5465      A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
5466      Is he gone, and hath nothing?
5467      BENVOLIO
5468      What, art thou hurt?
5469      MERCUTIO
5470      Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
5471      Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
5472      Exit Page

5473      ROMEO
5474      Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
5475      MERCUTIO
5476      No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
5477      church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
5478      me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
5479      am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
5480      both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
5481      cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
5482      rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
5483      arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
5484      was hurt under your arm.
5485      ROMEO
5486      I thought all for the best.
5487      MERCUTIO
5488      Help me into some house, Benvolio,
5489      Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
5490      They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
5491      And soundly too: your houses!
5492      Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

5493      ROMEO
5494      This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
5495      My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
5496      In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
5497      With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
5498      Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
5499      Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
5500      And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
5501      Re-enter BENVOLIO

5502      BENVOLIO
5503      O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
5504      That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
5505      Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
5506      ROMEO
5507      This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
5508      This but begins the woe, others must end.
5509      BENVOLIO
5510      Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
5511      ROMEO
5512      Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
5513      Away to heaven, respective lenity,
5514      And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
5515      Re-enter TYBALT

5516      Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
5517      That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
5518      Is but a little way above our heads,
5519      Staying for thine to keep him company:
5520      Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
5521      TYBALT
5522      Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
5523      Shalt with him hence.
5524      ROMEO
5525      This shall determine that.
5526      They fight; TYBALT falls

5527      BENVOLIO
5528      Romeo, away, be gone!
5529      The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
5530      Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
5531      If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
5532      ROMEO
5533      O, I am fortune's fool!
5534      BENVOLIO
5535      Why dost thou stay?
5536      Exit ROMEO

5537      Enter Citizens, & c

5538      First Citizen
5539      Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
5540      Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
5541      BENVOLIO
5542      There lies that Tybalt.
5543      First Citizen
5544      Up, sir, go with me;
5545      I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
5546      Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

5547      PRINCE
5548      Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
5549      BENVOLIO
5550      O noble prince, I can discover all
5551      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
5552      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
5553      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
5554      LADY CAPULET
5555      Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
5556      O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
5557      O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
5558      For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
5559      O cousin, cousin!
5560      PRINCE
5561      Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
5562      BENVOLIO
5563      Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
5564      Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
5565      How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
5566      Your high displeasure: all this uttered
5567      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
5568      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
5569      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
5570      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
5571      Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
5572      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
5573      Cold death aside, and with the other sends
5574      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
5575      Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
5576      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
5577      his tongue,
5578      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
5579      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
5580      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
5581      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
5582      But by and by comes back to Romeo,
5583      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
5584      And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
5585      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
5586      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
5587      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
5588      LADY CAPULET
5589      He is a kinsman to the Montague;
5590      Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
5591      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
5592      And all those twenty could but kill one life.
5593      I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
5594      Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
5595      PRINCE
5596      Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
5597      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
5598      MONTAGUE
5599      Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
5600      His fault concludes but what the law should end,
5601      The life of Tybalt.
5602      PRINCE
5603      And for that offence
5604      Immediately we do exile him hence:
5605      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
5606      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
5607      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
5608      That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
5609      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
5610      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
5611      Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
5612      Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
5613      Bear hence this body and attend our will:
5614      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
5615      Exeunt

5616      SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
5617      Enter JULIET
5618      JULIET
5619      Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
5620      Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
5621      As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
5622      And bring in cloudy night immediately.
5623      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
5624      That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
5625      Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
5626      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
5627      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
5628      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
5629      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
5630      And learn me how to lose a winning match,
5631      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
5632      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
5633      With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
5634      Think true love acted simple modesty.
5635      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
5636      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
5637      Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
5638      Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
5639      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
5640      Take him and cut him out in little stars,
5641      And he will make the face of heaven so fine
5642      That all the world will be in love with night
5643      And pay no worship to the garish sun.
5644      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
5645      But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
5646      Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
5647      As is the night before some festival
5648      To an impatient child that hath new robes
5649      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
5650      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
5651      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
5652      Enter Nurse, with cords

5653      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
5654      That Romeo bid thee fetch?
5655      Nurse
5656      Ay, ay, the cords.
5657      Throws them down

5658      JULIET
5659      Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
5660      Nurse
5661      Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
5662      We are undone, lady, we are undone!
5663      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
5664      JULIET
5665      Can heaven be so envious?
5666      Nurse
5667      Romeo can,
5668      Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
5669      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
5670      JULIET
5671      What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
5672      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
5673      Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
5674      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
5675      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
5676      I am not I, if there be such an I;
5677      Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
5678      If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
5679      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
5680      Nurse
5681      I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
5682      God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
5683      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
5684      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
5685      All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
5686      JULIET
5687      O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
5688      To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
5689      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
5690      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
5691      Nurse
5692      O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
5693      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
5694      That ever I should live to see thee dead!
5695      JULIET
5696      What storm is this that blows so contrary?
5697      Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
5698      My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
5699      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
5700      For who is living, if those two are gone?
5701      Nurse
5702      Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
5703      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
5704      JULIET
5705      O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
5706      Nurse
5707      It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
5708      JULIET
5709      O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
5710      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
5711      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
5712      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
5713      Despised substance of divinest show!
5714      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
5715      A damned saint, an honourable villain!
5716      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
5717      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
5718      In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
5719      Was ever book containing such vile matter
5720      So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
5721      In such a gorgeous palace!
5722      Nurse
5723      There's no trust,
5724      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
5725      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
5726      Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
5727      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
5728      Shame come to Romeo!
5729      JULIET
5730      Blister'd be thy tongue
5731      For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
5732      Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
5733      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
5734      Sole monarch of the universal earth.
5735      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
5736      Nurse
5737      Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
5738      JULIET
5739      Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
5740      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
5741      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
5742      But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
5743      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
5744      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
5745      Your tributary drops belong to woe,
5746      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
5747      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
5748      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
5749      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
5750      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
5751      That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
5752      But, O, it presses to my memory,
5753      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
5754      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
5755      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
5756      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
5757      Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
5758      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
5759      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
5760      Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
5761      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
5762      Which modern lamentations might have moved?
5763      But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
5764      'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
5765      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
5766      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
5767      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
5768      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
5769      Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
5770      Nurse
5771      Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
5772      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
5773      JULIET
5774      Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
5775      When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
5776      Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
5777      Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
5778      He made you for a highway to my bed;
5779      But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
5780      Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
5781      And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
5782      Nurse
5783      Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
5784      To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
5785      Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
5786      I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
5787      JULIET
5788      O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
5789      And bid him come to take his last farewell.
5790      Exeunt

5791      SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
5792      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
5793      FRIAR LAURENCE
5794      Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
5795      Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
5796      And thou art wedded to calamity.
5797      Enter ROMEO

5798      ROMEO
5799      Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
5800      What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
5801      That I yet know not?
5802      FRIAR LAURENCE
5803      Too familiar
5804      Is my dear son with such sour company:
5805      I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
5806      ROMEO
5807      What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
5808      FRIAR LAURENCE
5809      A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
5810      Not body's death, but body's banishment.
5811      ROMEO
5812      Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
5813      For exile hath more terror in his look,
5814      Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
5815      FRIAR LAURENCE
5816      Hence from Verona art thou banished:
5817      Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
5818      ROMEO
5819      There is no world without Verona walls,
5820      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
5821      Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
5822      And world's exile is death: then banished,
5823      Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
5824      Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
5825      And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
5826      FRIAR LAURENCE
5827      O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
5828      Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
5829      Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
5830      And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
5831      This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
5832      ROMEO
5833      'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
5834      Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
5835      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
5836      Live here in heaven and may look on her;
5837      But Romeo may not: more validity,
5838      More honourable state, more courtship lives
5839      In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
5840      On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
5841      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
5842      Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
5843      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
5844      But Romeo may not; he is banished:
5845      Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
5846      They are free men, but I am banished.
5847      And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
5848      Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
5849      No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
5850      But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
5851      O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
5852      Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
5853      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
5854      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
5855      To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
5856      FRIAR LAURENCE
5857      Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
5858      ROMEO
5859      O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
5860      FRIAR LAURENCE
5861      I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
5862      Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
5863      To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
5864      ROMEO
5865      Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
5866      Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
5867      Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
5868      It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
5869      FRIAR LAURENCE
5870      O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
5871      ROMEO
5872      How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
5873      FRIAR LAURENCE
5874      Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
5875      ROMEO
5876      Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
5877      Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
5878      An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
5879      Doting like me and like me banished,
5880      Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
5881      And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
5882      Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
5883      Knocking within

5884      FRIAR LAURENCE
5885      Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
5886      ROMEO
5887      Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
5888      Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
5889      Knocking

5890      FRIAR LAURENCE
5891      Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
5892      Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
5893      Knocking

5894      Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
5895      What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
5896      Knocking

5897      Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
5898      Nurse
5899      [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
5900      my errand;
5901      I come from Lady Juliet.
5902      FRIAR LAURENCE
5903      Welcome, then.
5904      Enter Nurse

5905      Nurse
5906      O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
5907      Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
5908      FRIAR LAURENCE
5909      There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
5910      Nurse
5911      O, he is even in my mistress' case,
5912      Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
5913      Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
5914      Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
5915      Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
5916      For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
5917      Why should you fall into so deep an O?
5918      ROMEO
5919      Nurse!
5920      Nurse
5921      Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
5922      ROMEO
5923      Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
5924      Doth she not think me an old murderer,
5925      Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
5926      With blood removed but little from her own?
5927      Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
5928      My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
5929      Nurse
5930      O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
5931      And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
5932      And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
5933      And then down falls again.
5934      ROMEO
5935      As if that name,
5936      Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
5937      Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
5938      Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
5939      In what vile part of this anatomy
5940      Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
5941      The hateful mansion.
5942      Drawing his sword

5943      FRIAR LAURENCE
5944      Hold thy desperate hand:
5945      Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
5946      Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
5947      The unreasonable fury of a beast:
5948      Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
5949      Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
5950      Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
5951      I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
5952      Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
5953      And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
5954      By doing damned hate upon thyself?
5955      Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
5956      Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
5957      In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
5958      Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
5959      Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
5960      And usest none in that true use indeed
5961      Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
5962      Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
5963      Digressing from the valour of a man;
5964      Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
5965      Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
5966      Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
5967      Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
5968      Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
5969      Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
5970      And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
5971      What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
5972      For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
5973      There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
5974      But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
5975      The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
5976      And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
5977      A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
5978      Happiness courts thee in her best array;
5979      But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
5980      Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
5981      Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
5982      Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
5983      Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
5984      But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
5985      For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
5986      Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
5987      To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
5988      Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
5989      With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
5990      Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
5991      Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
5992      And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
5993      Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
5994      Romeo is coming.
5995      Nurse
5996      O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
5997      To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
5998      My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
5999      ROMEO
6000      Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
6001      Nurse
6002      Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
6003      Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
6004      Exit

6005      ROMEO
6006      How well my comfort is revived by this!
6007      FRIAR LAURENCE
6008      Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
6009      Either be gone before the watch be set,
6010      Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
6011      Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
6012      And he shall signify from time to time
6013      Every good hap to you that chances here:
6014      Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
6015      ROMEO
6016      But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
6017      It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
6018      Exeunt

6019      SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
6020      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
6021      CAPULET
6022      Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
6023      That we have had no time to move our daughter:
6024      Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
6025      And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
6026      'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
6027      I promise you, but for your company,
6028      I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
6029      PARIS
6030      These times of woe afford no time to woo.
6031      Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
6032      LADY CAPULET
6033      I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
6034      To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
6035      CAPULET
6036      Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
6037      Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
6038      In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
6039      Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
6040      Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
6041      And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
6042      But, soft! what day is this?
6043      PARIS
6044      Monday, my lord,
6045      CAPULET
6046      Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
6047      O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
6048      She shall be married to this noble earl.
6049      Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
6050      We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
6051      For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
6052      It may be thought we held him carelessly,
6053      Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
6054      Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
6055      And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
6056      PARIS
6057      My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
6058      CAPULET
6059      Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
6060      Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
6061      Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
6062      Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
6063      Afore me! it is so very very late,
6064      That we may call it early by and by.
6065      Good night.
6066      Exeunt

6067      SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
6068      Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
6069      JULIET
6070      Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
6071      It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
6072      That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
6073      Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
6074      Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
6075      ROMEO
6076      It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
6077      No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
6078      Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
6079      Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
6080      Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
6081      I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
6082      JULIET
6083      Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
6084      It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
6085      To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
6086      And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
6087      Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
6088      ROMEO
6089      Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
6090      I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
6091      I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
6092      'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
6093      Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
6094      The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
6095      I have more care to stay than will to go:
6096      Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
6097      How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
6098      JULIET
6099      It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
6100      It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
6101      Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
6102      Some say the lark makes sweet division;
6103      This doth not so, for she divideth us:
6104      Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
6105      O, now I would they had changed voices too!
6106      Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
6107      Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
6108      O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
6109      ROMEO
6110      More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
6111      Enter Nurse, to the chamber

6112      Nurse
6113      Madam!
6114      JULIET
6115      Nurse?
6116      Nurse
6117      Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
6118      The day is broke; be wary, look about.
6119      Exit

6120      JULIET
6121      Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
6122      ROMEO
6123      Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
6124      He goeth down

6125      JULIET
6126      Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
6127      I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
6128      For in a minute there are many days:
6129      O, by this count I shall be much in years
6130      Ere I again behold my Romeo!
6131      ROMEO
6132      Farewell!
6133      I will omit no opportunity
6134      That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
6135      JULIET
6136      O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
6137      ROMEO
6138      I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
6139      For sweet discourses in our time to come.
6140      JULIET
6141      O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
6142      Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
6143      As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
6144      Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
6145      ROMEO
6146      And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
6147      Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
6148      Exit

6149      JULIET
6150      O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
6151      If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
6152      That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
6153      For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
6154      But send him back.
6155      LADY CAPULET
6156      [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
6157      JULIET
6158      Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
6159      Is she not down so late, or up so early?
6160      What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
6161      Enter LADY CAPULET

6162      LADY CAPULET
6163      Why, how now, Juliet!
6164      JULIET
6165      Madam, I am not well.
6166      LADY CAPULET
6167      Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
6168      What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
6169      An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
6170      Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
6171      But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
6172      JULIET
6173      Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
6174      LADY CAPULET
6175      So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
6176      Which you weep for.
6177      JULIET
6178      Feeling so the loss,
6179      Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
6180      LADY CAPULET
6181      Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
6182      As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
6183      JULIET
6184      What villain madam?
6185      LADY CAPULET
6186      That same villain, Romeo.
6187      JULIET
6188      [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
6189      God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
6190      And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
6191      LADY CAPULET
6192      That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
6193      JULIET
6194      Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
6195      Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
6196      LADY CAPULET
6197      We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
6198      Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
6199      Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
6200      Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
6201      That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
6202      And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
6203      JULIET
6204      Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
6205      With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
6206      Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
6207      Madam, if you could find out but a man
6208      To bear a poison, I would temper it;
6209      That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
6210      Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
6211      To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
6212      To wreak the love I bore my cousin
6213      Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
6214      LADY CAPULET
6215      Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
6216      But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
6217      JULIET
6218      And joy comes well in such a needy time:
6219      What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
6220      LADY CAPULET
6221      Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
6222      One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
6223      Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
6224      That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
6225      JULIET
6226      Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
6227      LADY CAPULET
6228      Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
6229      The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
6230      The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
6231      Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
6232      JULIET
6233      Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
6234      He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
6235      I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
6236      Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
6237      I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
6238      I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
6239      It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
6240      Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
6241      LADY CAPULET
6242      Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
6243      And see how he will take it at your hands.
6244      Enter CAPULET and Nurse

6245      CAPULET
6246      When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
6247      But for the sunset of my brother's son
6248      It rains downright.
6249      How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
6250      Evermore showering? In one little body
6251      Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
6252      For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
6253      Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
6254      Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
6255      Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
6256      Without a sudden calm, will overset
6257      Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
6258      Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
6259      LADY CAPULET
6260      Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
6261      I would the fool were married to her grave!
6262      CAPULET
6263      Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
6264      How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
6265      Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
6266      Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
6267      So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
6268      JULIET
6269      Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
6270      Proud can I never be of what I hate;
6271      But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
6272      CAPULET
6273      How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
6274      'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
6275      And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
6276      Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
6277      But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
6278      To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
6279      Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
6280      Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
6281      You tallow-face!
6282      LADY CAPULET
6283      Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
6284      JULIET
6285      Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
6286      Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
6287      CAPULET
6288      Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
6289      I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
6290      Or never after look me in the face:
6291      Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
6292      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
6293      That God had lent us but this only child;
6294      But now I see this one is one too much,
6295      And that we have a curse in having her:
6296      Out on her, hilding!
6297      Nurse
6298      God in heaven bless her!
6299      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
6300      CAPULET
6301      And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
6302      Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
6303      Nurse
6304      I speak no treason.
6305      CAPULET
6306      O, God ye god-den.
6307      Nurse
6308      May not one speak?
6309      CAPULET
6310      Peace, you mumbling fool!
6311      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
6312      For here we need it not.
6313      LADY CAPULET
6314      You are too hot.
6315      CAPULET
6316      God's bread! it makes me mad:
6317      Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
6318      Alone, in company, still my care hath been
6319      To have her match'd: and having now provided
6320      A gentleman of noble parentage,
6321      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
6322      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
6323      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
6324      And then to have a wretched puling fool,
6325      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
6326      To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
6327      I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
6328      But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
6329      Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
6330      Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
6331      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
6332      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
6333      And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
6334      the streets,
6335      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
6336      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
6337      Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
6338      Exit

6339      JULIET
6340      Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
6341      That sees into the bottom of my grief?
6342      O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
6343      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
6344      Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
6345      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
6346      LADY CAPULET
6347      Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
6348      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
6349      Exit

6350      JULIET
6351      O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
6352      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
6353      How shall that faith return again to earth,
6354      Unless that husband send it me from heaven
6355      By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
6356      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
6357      Upon so soft a subject as myself!
6358      What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
6359      Some comfort, nurse.
6360      Nurse
6361      Faith, here it is.
6362      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
6363      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
6364      Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
6365      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
6366      I think it best you married with the county.
6367      O, he's a lovely gentleman!
6368      Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
6369      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
6370      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
6371      I think you are happy in this second match,
6372      For it excels your first: or if it did not,
6373      Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
6374      As living here and you no use of him.
6375      JULIET
6376      Speakest thou from thy heart?
6377      Nurse
6378      And from my soul too;
6379      Or else beshrew them both.
6380      JULIET
6381      Amen!
6382      Nurse
6383      What?
6384      JULIET
6385      Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
6386      Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
6387      Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
6388      To make confession and to be absolved.
6389      Nurse
6390      Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
6391      Exit

6392      JULIET
6393      Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
6394      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
6395      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
6396      Which she hath praised him with above compare
6397      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
6398      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
6399      I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
6400      If all else fail, myself have power to die.
6401      Exit

6402      ACT IV
6403      SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
6404      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
6405      FRIAR LAURENCE
6406      On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
6407      PARIS
6408      My father Capulet will have it so;
6409      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
6410      FRIAR LAURENCE
6411      You say you do not know the lady's mind:
6412      Uneven is the course, I like it not.
6413      PARIS
6414      Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
6415      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
6416      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
6417      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
6418      That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
6419      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
6420      To stop the inundation of her tears;
6421      Which, too much minded by herself alone,
6422      May be put from her by society:
6423      Now do you know the reason of this haste.
6424      FRIAR LAURENCE
6425      [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
6426      Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
6427      Enter JULIET

6428      PARIS
6429      Happily met, my lady and my wife!
6430      JULIET
6431      That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
6432      PARIS
6433      That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
6434      JULIET
6435      What must be shall be.
6436      FRIAR LAURENCE
6437      That's a certain text.
6438      PARIS
6439      Come you to make confession to this father?
6440      JULIET
6441      To answer that, I should confess to you.
6442      PARIS
6443      Do not deny to him that you love me.
6444      JULIET
6445      I will confess to you that I love him.
6446      PARIS
6447      So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
6448      JULIET
6449      If I do so, it will be of more price,
6450      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
6451      PARIS
6452      Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
6453      JULIET
6454      The tears have got small victory by that;
6455      For it was bad enough before their spite.
6456      PARIS
6457      Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
6458      JULIET
6459      That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
6460      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
6461      PARIS
6462      Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
6463      JULIET
6464      It may be so, for it is not mine own.
6465      Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
6466      Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
6467      FRIAR LAURENCE
6468      My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
6469      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
6470      PARIS
6471      God shield I should disturb devotion!
6472      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
6473      Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
6474      Exit

6475      JULIET
6476      O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
6477      Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
6478      FRIAR LAURENCE
6479      Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
6480      It strains me past the compass of my wits:
6481      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
6482      On Thursday next be married to this county.
6483      JULIET
6484      Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
6485      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
6486      If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
6487      Do thou but call my resolution wise,
6488      And with this knife I'll help it presently.
6489      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
6490      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
6491      Shall be the label to another deed,
6492      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
6493      Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
6494      Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
6495      Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
6496      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
6497      Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
6498      Which the commission of thy years and art
6499      Could to no issue of true honour bring.
6500      Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
6501      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
6502      FRIAR LAURENCE
6503      Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
6504      Which craves as desperate an execution.
6505      As that is desperate which we would prevent.
6506      If, rather than to marry County Paris,
6507      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
6508      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
6509      A thing like death to chide away this shame,
6510      That copest with death himself to scape from it:
6511      And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
6512      JULIET
6513      O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
6514      From off the battlements of yonder tower;
6515      Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
6516      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
6517      Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
6518      O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
6519      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
6520      Or bid me go into a new-made grave
6521      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
6522      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
6523      And I will do it without fear or doubt,
6524      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
6525      FRIAR LAURENCE
6526      Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
6527      To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
6528      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
6529      Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
6530      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
6531      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
6532      When presently through all thy veins shall run
6533      A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
6534      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
6535      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
6536      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
6537      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
6538      Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
6539      Each part, deprived of supple government,
6540      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
6541      And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
6542      Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
6543      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
6544      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
6545      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
6546      Then, as the manner of our country is,
6547      In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
6548      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
6549      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
6550      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
6551      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
6552      And hither shall he come: and he and I
6553      Will watch thy waking, and that very night
6554      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
6555      And this shall free thee from this present shame;
6556      If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
6557      Abate thy valour in the acting it.
6558      JULIET
6559      Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
6560      FRIAR LAURENCE
6561      Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
6562      In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
6563      To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
6564      JULIET
6565      Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
6566      Farewell, dear father!
6567      Exeunt

6568      SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
6569      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
6570      CAPULET
6571      So many guests invite as here are writ.
6572      Exit First Servant

6573      Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
6574      Second Servant
6575      You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
6576      can lick their fingers.
6577      CAPULET
6578      How canst thou try them so?
6579      Second Servant
6580      Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
6581      own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
6582      fingers goes not with me.
6583      CAPULET
6584      Go, be gone.
6585      Exit Second Servant

6586      We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
6587      What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
6588      Nurse
6589      Ay, forsooth.
6590      CAPULET
6591      Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
6592      A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
6593      Nurse
6594      See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
6595      Enter JULIET

6596      CAPULET
6597      How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
6598      JULIET
6599      Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
6600      Of disobedient opposition
6601      To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
6602      By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
6603      And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
6604      Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
6605      CAPULET
6606      Send for the county; go tell him of this:
6607      I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
6608      JULIET
6609      I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
6610      And gave him what becomed love I might,
6611      Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
6612      CAPULET
6613      Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
6614      This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
6615      Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
6616      Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
6617      Our whole city is much bound to him.
6618      JULIET
6619      Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
6620      To help me sort such needful ornaments
6621      As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
6622      LADY CAPULET
6623      No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
6624      CAPULET
6625      Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
6626      Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

6627      LADY CAPULET
6628      We shall be short in our provision:
6629      'Tis now near night.
6630      CAPULET
6631      Tush, I will stir about,
6632      And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
6633      Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
6634      I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
6635      I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
6636      They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
6637      To County Paris, to prepare him up
6638      Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
6639      Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
6640      Exeunt

6641      SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
6642      Enter JULIET and Nurse
6643      JULIET
6644      Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
6645      I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
6646      For I have need of many orisons
6647      To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
6648      Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
6649      Enter LADY CAPULET

6650      LADY CAPULET
6651      What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
6652      JULIET
6653      No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
6654      As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
6655      So please you, let me now be left alone,
6656      And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
6657      For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
6658      In this so sudden business.
6659      LADY CAPULET
6660      Good night:
6661      Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
6662      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

6663      JULIET
6664      Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
6665      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
6666      That almost freezes up the heat of life:
6667      I'll call them back again to comfort me:
6668      Nurse! What should she do here?
6669      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
6670      Come, vial.
6671      What if this mixture do not work at all?
6672      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
6673      No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
6674      Laying down her dagger

6675      What if it be a poison, which the friar
6676      Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
6677      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
6678      Because he married me before to Romeo?
6679      I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
6680      For he hath still been tried a holy man.
6681      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
6682      I wake before the time that Romeo
6683      Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
6684      Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
6685      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
6686      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
6687      Or, if I live, is it not very like,
6688      The horrible conceit of death and night,
6689      Together with the terror of the place,--
6690      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
6691      Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
6692      Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
6693      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
6694      Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
6695      At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
6696      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
6697      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
6698      And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
6699      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
6700      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
6701      Environed with all these hideous fears?
6702      And madly play with my forefather's joints?
6703      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
6704      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
6705      As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
6706      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
6707      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
6708      Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
6709      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
6710      She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

6711      SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
6712      Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
6713      LADY CAPULET
6714      Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
6715      Nurse
6716      They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
6717      Enter CAPULET

6718      CAPULET
6719      Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
6720      The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
6721      Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
6722      Spare not for the cost.
6723      Nurse
6724      Go, you cot-quean, go,
6725      Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
6726      For this night's watching.
6727      CAPULET
6728      No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
6729      All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
6730      LADY CAPULET
6731      Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
6732      But I will watch you from such watching now.
6733      Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

6734      CAPULET
6735      A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
6736      Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets

6737      Now, fellow,
6738      What's there?
6739      First Servant
6740      Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
6741      CAPULET
6742      Make haste, make haste.
6743      Exit First Servant

6744      Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
6745      Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
6746      Second Servant
6747      I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
6748      And never trouble Peter for the matter.
6749      Exit

6750      CAPULET
6751      Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
6752      Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
6753      The county will be here with music straight,
6754      For so he said he would: I hear him near.
6755      Music within

6756      Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
6757      Re-enter Nurse

6758      Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
6759      I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
6760      Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
6761      Make haste, I say.
6762      Exeunt

6763      SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
6764      Enter Nurse
6765      Nurse
6766      Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
6767      Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
6768      Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
6769      What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
6770      Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
6771      The County Paris hath set up his rest,
6772      That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
6773      Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
6774      I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
6775      Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
6776      He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
6777      Undraws the curtains

6778      What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
6779      I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
6780      Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
6781      O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
6782      Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
6783      Enter LADY CAPULET

6784      LADY CAPULET
6785      What noise is here?
6786      Nurse
6787      O lamentable day!
6788      LADY CAPULET
6789      What is the matter?
6790      Nurse
6791      Look, look! O heavy day!
6792      LADY CAPULET
6793      O me, O me! My child, my only life,
6794      Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
6795      Help, help! Call help.
6796      Enter CAPULET

6797      CAPULET
6798      For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
6799      Nurse
6800      She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
6801      LADY CAPULET
6802      Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
6803      CAPULET
6804      Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
6805      Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
6806      Life and these lips have long been separated:
6807      Death lies on her like an untimely frost
6808      Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
6809      Nurse
6810      O lamentable day!
6811      LADY CAPULET
6812      O woful time!
6813      CAPULET
6814      Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
6815      Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
6816      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

6817      FRIAR LAURENCE
6818      Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
6819      CAPULET
6820      Ready to go, but never to return.
6821      O son! the night before thy wedding-day
6822      Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
6823      Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
6824      Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
6825      My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
6826      And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
6827      PARIS
6828      Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
6829      And doth it give me such a sight as this?
6830      LADY CAPULET
6831      Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
6832      Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
6833      In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
6834      But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
6835      But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
6836      And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
6837      Nurse
6838      O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
6839      Most lamentable day, most woful day,
6840      That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
6841      O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
6842      Never was seen so black a day as this:
6843      O woful day, O woful day!
6844      PARIS
6845      Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
6846      Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
6847      By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
6848      O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
6849      CAPULET
6850      Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
6851      Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
6852      To murder, murder our solemnity?
6853      O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
6854      Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
6855      And with my child my joys are buried.
6856      FRIAR LAURENCE
6857      Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
6858      In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
6859      Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
6860      And all the better is it for the maid:
6861      Your part in her you could not keep from death,
6862      But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
6863      The most you sought was her promotion;
6864      For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
6865      And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
6866      Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
6867      O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
6868      That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
6869      She's not well married that lives married long;
6870      But she's best married that dies married young.
6871      Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
6872      On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
6873      In all her best array bear her to church:
6874      For though fond nature bids us an lament,
6875      Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
6876      CAPULET
6877      All things that we ordained festival,
6878      Turn from their office to black funeral;
6879      Our instruments to melancholy bells,
6880      Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
6881      Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
6882      Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
6883      And all things change them to the contrary.
6884      FRIAR LAURENCE
6885      Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
6886      And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
6887      To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
6888      The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
6889      Move them no more by crossing their high will.
6890      Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

6891      First Musician
6892      Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
6893      Nurse
6894      Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
6895      For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
6896      Exit

6897      First Musician
6898      Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
6899      Enter PETER

6900      PETER
6901      Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
6902      ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
6903      First Musician
6904      Why 'Heart's ease?'
6905      PETER
6906      O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
6907      heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
6908      to comfort me.
6909      First Musician
6910      Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
6911      PETER
6912      You will not, then?
6913      First Musician
6914      No.
6915      PETER
6916      I will then give it you soundly.
6917      First Musician
6918      What will you give us?
6919      PETER
6920      No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
6921      I will give you the minstrel.
6922      First Musician
6923      Then I will give you the serving-creature.
6924      PETER
6925      Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
6926      your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
6927      I'll fa you; do you note me?
6928      First Musician
6929      An you re us and fa us, you note us.
6930      Second Musician
6931      Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
6932      PETER
6933      Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
6934      with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
6935      me like men:
6936      'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
6937      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
6938      Then music with her silver sound'--
6939      why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
6940      sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
6941      Musician
6942      Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
6943      PETER
6944      Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
6945      Second Musician
6946      I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
6947      PETER
6948      Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
6949      Third Musician
6950      Faith, I know not what to say.
6951      PETER
6952      O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
6953      for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
6954      because musicians have no gold for sounding:
6955      'Then music with her silver sound
6956      With speedy help doth lend redress.'
6957      Exit

6958      First Musician
6959      What a pestilent knave is this same!
6960      Second Musician
6961      Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
6962      mourners, and stay dinner.
6963      Exeunt

6964      ACT V
6965      SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
6966      Enter ROMEO
6967      ROMEO
6968      If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
6969      My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
6970      My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
6971      And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
6972      Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
6973      I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
6974      Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
6975      to think!--
6976      And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
6977      That I revived, and was an emperor.
6978      Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
6979      When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
6980      Enter BALTHASAR, booted

6981      News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
6982      Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
6983      How doth my lady? Is my father well?
6984      How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
6985      For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
6986      BALTHASAR
6987      Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
6988      Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
6989      And her immortal part with angels lives.
6990      I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
6991      And presently took post to tell it you:
6992      O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
6993      Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
6994      ROMEO
6995      Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
6996      Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
6997      And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
6998      BALTHASAR
6999      I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
7000      Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
7001      Some misadventure.
7002      ROMEO
7003      Tush, thou art deceived:
7004      Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
7005      Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
7006      BALTHASAR
7007      No, my good lord.
7008      ROMEO
7009      No matter: get thee gone,
7010      And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
7011      Exit BALTHASAR

7012      Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
7013      Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
7014      To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
7015      I do remember an apothecary,--
7016      And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
7017      In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
7018      Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
7019      Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
7020      And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
7021      An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
7022      Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
7023      A beggarly account of empty boxes,
7024      Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
7025      Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
7026      Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
7027      Noting this penury, to myself I said
7028      'An if a man did need a poison now,
7029      Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
7030      Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
7031      O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
7032      And this same needy man must sell it me.
7033      As I remember, this should be the house.
7034      Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
7035      What, ho! apothecary!
7036      Enter Apothecary

7037      Apothecary
7038      Who calls so loud?
7039      ROMEO
7040      Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
7041      Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
7042      A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
7043      As will disperse itself through all the veins
7044      That the life-weary taker may fall dead
7045      And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
7046      As violently as hasty powder fired
7047      Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
7048      Apothecary
7049      Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
7050      Is death to any he that utters them.
7051      ROMEO
7052      Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
7053      And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
7054      Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
7055      Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
7056      The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
7057      The world affords no law to make thee rich;
7058      Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
7059      Apothecary
7060      My poverty, but not my will, consents.
7061      ROMEO
7062      I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
7063      Apothecary
7064      Put this in any liquid thing you will,
7065      And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
7066      Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
7067      ROMEO
7068      There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
7069      Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
7070      Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
7071      I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
7072      Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
7073      Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
7074      To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
7075      Exeunt

7076      SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
7077      Enter FRIAR JOHN
7078      FRIAR JOHN
7079      Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
7080      Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

7081      FRIAR LAURENCE
7082      This same should be the voice of Friar John.
7083      Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
7084      Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
7085      FRIAR JOHN
7086      Going to find a bare-foot brother out
7087      One of our order, to associate me,
7088      Here in this city visiting the sick,
7089      And finding him, the searchers of the town,
7090      Suspecting that we both were in a house
7091      Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
7092      Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
7093      So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
7094      FRIAR LAURENCE
7095      Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
7096      FRIAR JOHN
7097      I could not send it,--here it is again,--
7098      Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
7099      So fearful were they of infection.
7100      FRIAR LAURENCE
7101      Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
7102      The letter was not nice but full of charge
7103      Of dear import, and the neglecting it
7104      May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
7105      Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
7106      Unto my cell.
7107      FRIAR JOHN
7108      Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
7109      Exit

7110      FRIAR LAURENCE
7111      Now must I to the monument alone;
7112      Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
7113      She will beshrew me much that Romeo
7114      Hath had no notice of these accidents;
7115      But I will write again to Mantua,
7116      And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
7117      Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
7118      Exit

7119      SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
7120      Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
7121      PARIS
7122      Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
7123      Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
7124      Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
7125      Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
7126      So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
7127      Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
7128      But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
7129      As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
7130      Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
7131      PAGE
7132      [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
7133      Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
7134      Retires

7135      PARIS
7136      Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
7137      O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
7138      Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
7139      Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
7140      The obsequies that I for thee will keep
7141      Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
7142      The Page whistles

7143      The boy gives warning something doth approach.
7144      What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
7145      To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
7146      What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
7147      Retires

7148      Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

7149      ROMEO
7150      Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
7151      Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
7152      See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
7153      Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
7154      Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
7155      And do not interrupt me in my course.
7156      Why I descend into this bed of death,
7157      Is partly to behold my lady's face;
7158      But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
7159      A precious ring, a ring that I must use
7160      In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
7161      But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
7162      In what I further shall intend to do,
7163      By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
7164      And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
7165      The time and my intents are savage-wild,
7166      More fierce and more inexorable far
7167      Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
7168      BALTHASAR
7169      I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
7170      ROMEO
7171      So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
7172      Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
7173      BALTHASAR
7174      [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
7175      His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
7176      Retires

7177      ROMEO
7178      Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
7179      Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
7180      Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
7181      And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
7182      Opens the tomb

7183      PARIS
7184      This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
7185      That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
7186      It is supposed, the fair creature died;
7187      And here is come to do some villanous shame
7188      To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
7189      Comes forward

7190      Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
7191      Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
7192      Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
7193      Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
7194      ROMEO
7195      I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
7196      Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
7197      Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
7198      Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
7199      Put not another sin upon my head,
7200      By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
7201      By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
7202      For I come hither arm'd against myself:
7203      Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
7204      A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
7205      PARIS
7206      I do defy thy conjurations,
7207      And apprehend thee for a felon here.
7208      ROMEO
7209      Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
7210      They fight

7211      PAGE
7212      O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
7213      Exit

7214      PARIS
7215      O, I am slain!
7216      Falls

7217      If thou be merciful,
7218      Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
7219      Dies

7220      ROMEO
7221      In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
7222      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
7223      What said my man, when my betossed soul
7224      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
7225      He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
7226      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
7227      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
7228      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
7229      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
7230      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
7231      A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
7232      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
7233      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
7234      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
7235      Laying PARIS in the tomb

7236      How oft when men are at the point of death
7237      Have they been merry! which their keepers call
7238      A lightning before death: O, how may I
7239      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
7240      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
7241      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
7242      Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
7243      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
7244      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
7245      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
7246      O, what more favour can I do to thee,
7247      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
7248      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
7249      Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
7250      Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
7251      That unsubstantial death is amorous,
7252      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
7253      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
7254      For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
7255      And never from this palace of dim night
7256      Depart again: here, here will I remain
7257      With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
7258      Will I set up my everlasting rest,
7259      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
7260      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
7261      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
7262      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
7263      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
7264      Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
7265      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
7266      The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
7267      Here's to my love!
7268      Drinks

7269      O true apothecary!
7270      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
7271      Dies

7272      Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

7273      FRIAR LAURENCE
7274      Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
7275      Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
7276      BALTHASAR
7277      Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
7278      FRIAR LAURENCE
7279      Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
7280      What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
7281      To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
7282      It burneth in the Capel's monument.
7283      BALTHASAR
7284      It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
7285      One that you love.
7286      FRIAR LAURENCE
7287      Who is it?
7288      BALTHASAR
7289      Romeo.
7290      FRIAR LAURENCE
7291      How long hath he been there?
7292      BALTHASAR
7293      Full half an hour.
7294      FRIAR LAURENCE
7295      Go with me to the vault.
7296      BALTHASAR
7297      I dare not, sir
7298      My master knows not but I am gone hence;
7299      And fearfully did menace me with death,
7300      If I did stay to look on his intents.
7301      FRIAR LAURENCE
7302      Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
7303      O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
7304      BALTHASAR
7305      As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
7306      I dreamt my master and another fought,
7307      And that my master slew him.
7308      FRIAR LAURENCE
7309      Romeo!
7310      Advances

7311      Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
7312      The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
7313      What mean these masterless and gory swords
7314      To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
7315      Enters the tomb

7316      Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
7317      And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
7318      Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
7319      The lady stirs.
7320      JULIET wakes

7321      JULIET
7322      O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
7323      I do remember well where I should be,
7324      And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
7325      Noise within

7326      FRIAR LAURENCE
7327      I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
7328      Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
7329      A greater power than we can contradict
7330      Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
7331      Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
7332      And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
7333      Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
7334      Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
7335      Come, go, good Juliet,
7336      Noise again

7337      I dare no longer stay.
7338      JULIET
7339      Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
7340      Exit FRIAR LAURENCE

7341      What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
7342      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
7343      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
7344      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
7345      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
7346      To make die with a restorative.
7347      Kisses him

7348      Thy lips are warm.
7349      First Watchman
7350      [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
7351      JULIET
7352      Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
7353      Snatching ROMEO's dagger

7354      This is thy sheath;
7355      Stabs herself

7356      there rust, and let me die.
7357      Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

7358      Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

7359      PAGE
7360      This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
7361      First Watchman
7362      The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
7363      Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
7364      Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
7365      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
7366      Who here hath lain these two days buried.
7367      Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
7368      Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
7369      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
7370      But the true ground of all these piteous woes
7371      We cannot without circumstance descry.
7372      Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

7373      Second Watchman
7374      Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
7375      First Watchman
7376      Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
7377      Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

7378      Third Watchman
7379      Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
7380      We took this mattock and this spade from him,
7381      As he was coming from this churchyard side.
7382      First Watchman
7383      A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
7384      Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

7385      PRINCE
7386      What misadventure is so early up,
7387      That calls our person from our morning's rest?
7388      Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

7389      CAPULET
7390      What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
7391      LADY CAPULET
7392      The people in the street cry Romeo,
7393      Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
7394      With open outcry toward our monument.
7395      PRINCE
7396      What fear is this which startles in our ears?
7397      First Watchman
7398      Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
7399      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
7400      Warm and new kill'd.
7401      PRINCE
7402      Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
7403      First Watchman
7404      Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
7405      With instruments upon them, fit to open
7406      These dead men's tombs.
7407      CAPULET
7408      O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
7409      This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
7410      Is empty on the back of Montague,--
7411      And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
7412      LADY CAPULET
7413      O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
7414      That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
7415      Enter MONTAGUE and others

7416      PRINCE
7417      Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
7418      To see thy son and heir more early down.
7419      MONTAGUE
7420      Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
7421      Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
7422      What further woe conspires against mine age?
7423      PRINCE
7424      Look, and thou shalt see.
7425      MONTAGUE
7426      O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
7427      To press before thy father to a grave?
7428      PRINCE
7429      Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
7430      Till we can clear these ambiguities,
7431      And know their spring, their head, their
7432      true descent;
7433      And then will I be general of your woes,
7434      And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
7435      And let mischance be slave to patience.
7436      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
7437      FRIAR LAURENCE
7438      I am the greatest, able to do least,
7439      Yet most suspected, as the time and place
7440      Doth make against me of this direful murder;
7441      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
7442      Myself condemned and myself excused.
7443      PRINCE
7444      Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
7445      FRIAR LAURENCE
7446      I will be brief, for my short date of breath
7447      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
7448      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
7449      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
7450      I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
7451      Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
7452      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
7453      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
7454      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
7455      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
7456      To County Paris: then comes she to me,
7457      And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
7458      To rid her from this second marriage,
7459      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
7460      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
7461      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
7462      As I intended, for it wrought on her
7463      The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
7464      That he should hither come as this dire night,
7465      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
7466      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
7467      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
7468      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
7469      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
7470      At the prefixed hour of her waking,
7471      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
7472      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
7473      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
7474      But when I came, some minute ere the time
7475      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
7476      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
7477      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
7478      And bear this work of heaven with patience:
7479      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
7480      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
7481      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
7482      All this I know; and to the marriage
7483      Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
7484      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
7485      Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
7486      Unto the rigour of severest law.
7487      PRINCE
7488      We still have known thee for a holy man.
7489      Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
7490      BALTHASAR
7491      I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
7492      And then in post he came from Mantua
7493      To this same place, to this same monument.
7494      This letter he early bid me give his father,
7495      And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
7496      I departed not and left him there.
7497      PRINCE
7498      Give me the letter; I will look on it.
7499      Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
7500      Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
7501      PAGE
7502      He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
7503      And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
7504      Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
7505      And by and by my master drew on him;
7506      And then I ran away to call the watch.
7507      PRINCE
7508      This letter doth make good the friar's words,
7509      Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
7510      And here he writes that he did buy a poison
7511      Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
7512      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
7513      Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
7514      See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
7515      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
7516      And I for winking at your discords too
7517      Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
7518      CAPULET
7519      O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
7520      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
7521      Can I demand.
7522      MONTAGUE
7523      But I can give thee more:
7524      For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
7525      That while Verona by that name is known,
7526      There shall no figure at such rate be set
7527      As that of true and faithful Juliet.
7528      CAPULET
7529      As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
7530      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
7531      PRINCE
7532      A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
7533      The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
7534      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
7535      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
7536      For never was a story of more woe
7537      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
7538      Exeunt
